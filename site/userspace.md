# Userspace & syscalls

Real EL0 user programs run under VirelaiOS, loaded from the host share by `exec`
and scheduled as processes. The syscall boundary is a frozen, numbered ABI.

## The ABI (ADR 0007)

The syscall ABI is frozen in `docs/decisions/0007-syscall-abi.md`: the syscall
number goes in x8, arguments in x0–x5, the result in x0, dispatched through a
runtime-built **128-slot** table. **Eighty slots are implemented**
(0–79); the remaining slots return `ENOSYS`.

| 7 | `procs` | read-only process-table snapshot |
| 8 | `wait` | block until a peer exits, return its status |

| 28 | `exec` | launch another EL0 program (the desktop launcher's seam) |
| 29 | `kill` | terminate a running EL0 program (the process monitor's kill button; `TOP.BIN` was retired to `GOTOP.ELF`) |
| 30–33 | `tcp_connect` / `tcp_send` / `tcp_recv` / `tcp_close` | bounded TCP from EL0 |

| 79 | `fs_metadata` | bounded filesystem metadata and contained operations (B3) |

## Fault-safe uaccess

Pointer-taking syscalls copy through a `uaccess` layer that enforces the EL0
apertures (text read-only, stack read-write) and returns `EFAULT` (`-3`)
rather than faulting the kernel. A masked recovery window latches a real EL1
data abort, advances ELR past the faulting instruction, and converts it into a
clean `EFAULT`. The `uaccess` command proves the recovery live.

## Exec and processes

`exec <file> [args...]` streams a flat image out of the host share (a
stateless channel read), strips its header, rebuilds the EL0 user root
around its page, packs a bounded argv
block into the text page, and spawns it. Dynamic ELF executables (M30/M31)
ride the same seam: `LD.SO` inspects `PT_DYNAMIC`, resolves imports against
the pre-staged shared-library aperture, relocates the GOT, and jumps to
`AT_ENTRY` — still zero libc, zero POSIX. Programs are real processes with a
lifecycle: `running → exited → zombie → reaped`, with exit status preserved
past the reap.

## Inter-process communication

- **Mailbox** — `sys_ipc_send`/`sys_ipc_recv` move bytes between two live
  processes through bounded per-process rings.
- **Wait** — `sys_wait(target)` blocks the caller until the target exits and
  returns its status (event-driven, not POSIX wait).
- **Kill** — the monitor's `kill <pid|name>` ends a never-exiting program with
  the reserved status 137; the kernel owns lifetime, not the program.

## What EL0 cannot do

EL0 reaches only its own text and stack leaves. It cannot touch kernel RAM,
firmware, or MMIO, and its windows and sockets are kernel-owned — the
owner-restricted [[capabilities|window and UDP]] syscalls refuse
cross-process access.

**LIVE-GATED.** Concurrent programs, exit-status propagation, the IPC round
trip, the UDP and TCP syscall seams, the event loop, the userland file ABI,
and the desktop apps are each proven by a dedicated class B gate —
`live-concurrent`, `live-wait`, `live-ipc`,
`live-net-udp-syscall`, `live-net-tcp-syscall`,
`live-events`, `live-user-fs`, `live-desktop`, and
`live-sys-kill`.
