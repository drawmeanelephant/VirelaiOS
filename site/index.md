# VirelaiOS

VirelaiOS is a from-scratch AArch64 operating system. It boots under real UEFI
firmware on **Apple silicon**, hosted by Apple's **Virtualization.framework**
(macOS **27 or newer**). It is **not Linux, not Unix, and not QEMU** — no
libc, no POSIX, no existing guest OS, no emulator anywhere in the boot path.

The guest is written in freestanding [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) (no standard
library); the host launcher is Swift. The kernel seizes the machine itself:
it ends UEFI Boot Services, installs its own page tables, and drives the
hardware directly through virtio and MMIO drivers.

The name is a joke. The engineering is not. Every subsystem this site describes
is either **verified deterministically** or **live-gated on real hardware** —
see [[evidence]].

## Current status

Every milestone through **M86** has landed, and all but one index is closed on
the tracker (observed 2026-09-29); the open one is M84, remote framebuffer. The
table below is the first 31 —
the arc this site grew alongside; the
always-current accounting for everything since is
[`docs/status.md`](https://github.com/drawmeanelephant/DipshitOS/blob/main/docs/status.md)
and [[roadmap]]:

**The boot default is the Go seat.** A single boot autostarts `GOTABWM.ELF`,
which hosts Go EL0 clients — the shell `GOSH.ELF`, the editor `NOTE.ELF`, the
calculator `GOCALC.ELF`, the browser `WEB.ELF` — as tabs over the `WM_RPC`
contract; Zig `TABWM.BIN` is retained by decision (ADR 0034) as the
`settings set wm tabwm` fallback. M71 seat honesty and M72 Charm TUI have
closed since — read
[`docs/status.md`](https://github.com/drawmeanelephant/DipshitOS/blob/main/docs/status.md)
for what is open today instead of a date-stamped claim from this page. The Go
toolchain already builds and runs programs in-guest (`live-selfhost-go`).

<Aside kind="info">

**VERIFIED.** Everything on this site reflects what is actually landed and
live-gated today, not roadmap wishcasting. Where a feature is unit-tested
only, deterministic only, live-tested, or hardware-specific, the page says
which.

</Aside>

## What runs today

A single boot of VirelaiOS gets you, in order:

- A UEFI boot loader that hands off to a freestanding kernel.
- A live interactive monitor (`virelai>` prompt) over the serial console.
- A graphical framebuffer with a real terminal on screen — **Road Pops**.
- A window manager — **Driving Award** — compositing a terminal and a live
  clock overlay.
- EL0 user programs, exec'd from the host share, running as real processes
  with a syscall ABI of **78 implemented slots** (of a 128-slot table) covering IPC,
  windows, files, events, process control, TCP, filesystem mutation,
  clipboard, app timers, audio, pipes, fonts, ping, net-stats, and anonymous
  memory.
- Networking from raw Ethernet frames up through ARP, IPv4/ICMP, UDP, DHCP,
  and TCP — client **and** passive-open server (`GOHTTPD.ELF` serves the
  guest's own files over HTTP/1.1; the Zig `HTTPD.BIN` was retired in M71l)
  — plus an RFC 1035 DNS resolver.
- Two CPU cores: SMP scheduling with spinlocks and GICv3 inter-processor
  interrupts.
- Dynamic executables: `CALC.ELF`/`NOTEPAD.ELF`/`FILE.ELF`/`DESKTOP.ELF`
  linked at runtime by `LD.SO` against `LIBUI.SO`/`LIBFONT.SO`, plus
  `dlopen`/`dlsym` plugin loading — zero libc anywhere.
- USB keyboard input, enumerated over a real XHCI controller, typing into the
  terminal.
- A graphical desktop: the `GOTABWM.ELF` seat with a working calculator
  (`GOCALC.ELF`, which was Zig `CALC.BIN`), a persistent text editor
  (`NOTE.ELF`, which was Zig `NOTEPAD.BIN` until M66c), a click-to-kill
  process monitor (`GOTOP.ELF`, which was `TOP.BIN`/`SYSMON.BIN` until
  M71g), and a file browser over the host share (`GOFILES.ELF`).
- Userland network applications: an HTTP client (`GOFETCH.ELF`, which
  replaced retired `FETCH.BIN`), an in-guest HTTP/1.1 web server
  (`GOHTTPD.ELF`; the Zig `HTTPD.BIN` was retired in M71l) that serves the
  guest's own files to the host, and the Go network diagnostics
  (`GOPING.ELF`, `GONETSTAT.ELF`, `GODNS.ELF`, `GOTRACEROUTE.ELF`).
- Keyboard, pointer, and window events routed to focused applications, so an
  EL0 program runs an interactive event loop.
- A shared clipboard (copy/cut/paste across text apps) and per-process
  application timers that post `TIMER` events instead of spin loops.
- Sound: a virtio-snd device, PCM playback from EL0, a boot chime, and a
  melody app that plays Twinkle Twinkle Little Star.

![A live VirelaiOS boot: the Go seat GOTABWM with its tab strip across the top and the Go editor NOTE.ELF hosting a document in the tab below](index.assets/screenshot.png "A live VirelaiOS boot")

*A live boot, captured by the runner's own framebuffer path — one boot,
`--screen` + `--screenshot-after` waiting on a guest marker, 2560x1440 (the
1280x720 scanout at 2x). The default **Go seat** `GOTABWM.ELF` is hosting the
Go editor `NOTE.ELF`, which loaded `/host/notes.txt` out of the host share. No
phone camera and no stock art; `docs/testing.md` has the recipe.*

| | |
|---|---|
| ![GOSH on the Go seat](index.assets/gosh.png) | ![NOTE on the Go seat](index.assets/note.png) |
| ![GOCALC on the Go seat](index.assets/gocalc.png) | ![WEB rendering a page in-guest](index.assets/web.png) |

*The rest of the corpus, captured through the same path, one boot each: the
shell `GOSH.ELF`, the editor, the calculator, and the browser rendering a page
in-guest. The pixels exposed two things the markers could not see. The first —
`GOSH.ELF`'s tab holding no pixels while the shell's own markers were green
(observed on
[#1529](https://github.com/drawmeanelephant/DipshitOS/issues/1529)) — was
diagnosed and fixed by M69g
([#1558](https://github.com/drawmeanelephant/DipshitOS/issues/1558)): the
seat's own client-death probe window painted its chrome over the tab's first
line, a band holding 55 terminal-green pixels before the fix and 578 after, and
`go-dogfood` boot 03 now fails on a blank tab. `gosh.png` above is therefore a
capture from **before** that fix. The second — kernel console text on the
scanout wherever no window covers it — is still true and still asserted by
nothing. Regenerate them with `docs/testing.md`; the PNGs are the pinned
fixtures, the serial logs are not committed.*

## What it runs on

- **Host:** Apple silicon, macOS 27 or newer, Apple's Virtualization.framework.
- **Guest:** AArch64, freestanding Zig (pinned **Zig 0.16.0**), no libc.
- **Not supported:** Linux, Unix, QEMU, x86, any other emulator. There is
  deliberately no QEMU path.

## Start here

- [[getting-started|Getting started]] — build it, run it, what you need.
- [[architecture|Architecture]] — how the kernel and its subsystems fit together.
- [[capabilities|Current capabilities]] — what actually works today, subsystem by subsystem.
- [[roadmap|Roadmap & status]] — what has landed and what comes next.
- [[names|Project names & lore]] — what "Road Pops" and "Driving Award" mean.
- [[evidence|Evidence & testing]] — how a claimed feature is proven to work.

## Who this is for

Someone who looks at an operating system called *VirelaiOS* and still wants to
know how the MMU handoff works, how the compositor repaints, or how a DHCP
lease is renewed — and who appreciates that the answer comes with a gate and a
claim number instead of a screenshot and a shrug.

<Aside kind="warning">

**LIMITATION.** This is a research/hobby operating system running inside a
virtual machine on one vendor's hardware. It is not a general-purpose OS, not
production software, and not a drop-in for anything you already run.
