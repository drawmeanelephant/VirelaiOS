"""Conservative whole-image stack bound for the pinned C2 guest path.

Charge EVERY emitted function once, not just a sampled execution path, then
charge each data-recursive SCC eight extra times. The iterative guest preflight
bounds template blocks, condition-tree complexity and JSON container depth at
eight. JSON also bounds the Markdown orphan-list recursion and value equality.
Allocator/writer/reader callbacks cannot re-enter the engine. Those callbacks
are charged by the whole-image sum, including the SDK's unused typed vtable.

Panic transitions are terminal: the allocation-free native diagnostic handler
does not format, recurse into engine/Io writers, or use a hosted debug backend.
Its checked console counters advance only by confirmed in-range byte counts.
Thus safety-panic backedges are not input-recursive SCCs. New cycles or stack
adjustments fail closed; compiler/source pins are checked separately.
