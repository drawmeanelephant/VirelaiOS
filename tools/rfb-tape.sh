# rfb-tape.sh -- M84d/M84e class-C demo: a real macOS Screen Sharing viewer
# against the guest seat, through rfbprobe's loopback-only one-viewer bridge
# (ADR 0037 D5(1)) on the hermetic --net stream. Records the guest's own
# scanout as PNGs under gitignored artifacts/. Never gate evidence: the gate
# is live-rfb.spec. Exits 3 with the viewer's transcript when the viewer
# never completes the RFB handshake, instead of producing an empty tape.
# The host bridge's one-shot VNC password crosses a private FIFO, not the
# VMRunner's captured stderr (runner.log); the guest still speaks None.

# Answer Screen Sharing's own password sheet through System Events, so an

# This is RACE-CRITICAL, not cosmetic: the runner has already dialled the
# guest, so the guest's RFB handshake budget (vi.DefaultRecvBudgetNs, 30 s)
# is burning from the moment the bridge starts listening. The password must
# land well inside that. Hence a 0.1 s poll on the one button that proves
# the password sheet is up, and a direct field write rather than
# synthesizing keystrokes. The bridge's one-shot password is alphanumeric
# (bridge_auth.go), so no modifier keys are needed either way.
# Best effort by design: on any failure the operator can still type the
# printed password, and the bridge allows three pre-auth attempts.
# Requires Accessibility for the calling app.

Boots the seat with --rfb-hermetic, bridges one viewer from 127.0.0.1:$PORT
(RFB_TAPE_PORT, default 5901) into the guest, and opens vnc://127.0.0.1:$PORT
in macOS Screen Sharing. --no-viewer leaves viewer launch to the operator.
--type-password answers Screen Sharing's own password prompt through
System Events instead of waiting for a human (needs Accessibility for the
app that runs this script). Off by default; --no-viewer ignores it.
Enter the printed one-shot password in Screen Sharing, then disconnect
after the desktop appears so the tape can record session teardown.
RFB_TAPE_OUT selects the artifact directory. The bridge serves one
authenticated loopback viewer (up to three pre-auth attempts); the guest
wire remains None.
