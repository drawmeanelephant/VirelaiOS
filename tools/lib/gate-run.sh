# gate-run.sh -- per-run isolation for live (class-B) gates.
# Issue #523 item 2, claim 6637. Source this from a verify-live-* script:
#
#   source "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")/../lib/gate-run.sh"   # from tools/
#   gate_begin live-net-tcp
#   ... run VMRunner with "${GATE_RUNNER_ARGS[@]}", --serial "$RUN_DIR/vm-serial.log",
#       scratch files under "$RUN_DIR", evidence copied back to artifacts/ ... (optionally
#       gate_seed_share to arm the host file channel seeded with the app bundle) ...
#   gate_end
#
# gate_begin NAME:
#   - creates a private RUN_DIR (mktemp -d); two concurrent runs of the same
#     or different gates never share writable state;
#   - fills GATE_RUNNER_ARGS: --overlay-base artifacts/disk.img --vars <vars>
#     (macOS 27 DiskImageKit stacked image — M34 HF6 issue #740: the ONE
#     shared read-only boot image; every gate attaches the same canonical
#     artifacts/disk.img opened READ-ONLY as the base; the loader's own
#     pre-exit writes (BOOTED.TXT / MEMMAP.TXT / LOADER.TXT) plus all guest
#     writes land in a throwaway per-run ASIF overlay the runner deletes at
#     exit). No per-gate disk copy, no gate_shared_disk_lock: the base is
#     never written, so concurrent gates cannot collide on it. The image
#     build is atomic (make-image.sh writes IMAGE.tmp then renames), so a
#     gate that rebuilds artifacts/disk.img while another attaches it always
#     sees a complete image.
# gate_seed_share:
#   - arms the guest host file channel for this gate: creates $RUN_DIR/share,
#     copies the app bundle (zig-out/bin) into it, generates the ELF/.SO
#     fixtures (HELLO.ELF, CRASH.ELF, LD.SO, LIBUI.SO, ...) fresh, drops the
#     APPS.TXT manifest in, and appends --cvc-file "$SHARE" to
#     GATE_RUNNER_ARGS. A gate that execs a guest app MUST
#     call this; gates that only read the serial port can skip it.
# gate_end:
#   - removes RUN_DIR unless VIRELAI_KEEP_RUN=1 (post-mortem escape hatch).
#
# Evidence policy: copy what you need back into artifacts/ BEFORE gate_end
# using the gate's canonical names. Two concurrent instances of the SAME
# gate may race on those canonical copies (last writer wins) but can no
# longer corrupt each other's runs.

# --- the shell floor (issue #1338) -------------------------------------------
# A class-B harness must never be able to report a PASS it did not earn. Under
# `set -u`, bash < 4.4 expands an EMPTY array (`"${VGATE_NOTES[@]}"` with no
# notes -- most specs) into a FATAL error whose exit status is ZERO: the
# harness dies mid-plan, after the build preamble and before any boot, and the
# caller reads PASS for a gate that never ran. Observed live 2026-09-15 with
# /bin/bash 3.2.57 -- macOS's own, which is what a non-interactive shell gets
# when /usr/bin leads PATH: `PASS go-fart (16s)`, no VM, no serial log, no
# asserts evaluated. Rather than audit every array expansion in every harness
# for a 20-year-old shell, the floor is named once and checked at the door.

# real CI run caught two gates whose echo expectations no longer matched the

# --- VZ preflight -------------------------------------------------------------
# Two class-B failures both surface at VM boot looking like something else, and
# both are cheap to name in advance:
#
#   1. A runner built with a bare `swift build` -- i.e. without gate_build_
#      runner's codesign step -- carries no entitlements. Virtualization.
#      framework then refuses it, and the failure reads like a hardware or
#      configuration problem instead of a missing signature. VGATE_NO_BUILD=1
#      makes this reachable for a stale binary nobody re-signed.
#   2. A host without Hypervisor.framework cannot boot a guest at all, and the
#      gate that fails gets blamed instead of the host. Measured 2026-09-14 on
#      GitHub's hosted runners: kern.hv_support=0 with hv_vmm_present=1 (the
#      runner is itself a guest), and a direct hv_vm_create returns
#      0xfae9400f HV_UNSUPPORTED.
#
# Note the code in (2) matters: a MIS-SIGNED hv_vm_create probe returns
# 0xfae94007 HV_DENIED instead -- a verdict about the signature standing where
# a verdict about the machine is expected. That is exactly why the entitlement
# is asserted separately here, and why docs/vz-runner.md keeps the two apart.
