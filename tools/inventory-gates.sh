# inventory-gates.sh -- regenerate (or --check) the machine-generated gate
# fleet inventory (M40 GF1, issue #934; fleet section M40 GF5, issue #940).
#
# Every executable script directly under tools/ gets one row: line count,
# class (A/B/C/D/tooling -- explicit exceptions below, prefix defaults
# otherwise), registration status (just recipe? in the spec-dir class-B
# fleet? named in a workflow, directly or through a `just` recipe the
# workflow delegates to? status.md row?), and a one-line purpose scraped
# from its own header comment. A gate-class script registered nowhere is
# listed as an ORPHAN. Since GF5 the class-B fleet itself is discovered from
# tools/gate/specs/ via tools/gate/fleet.sh and rendered as its own
# section -- the same list `just verify-vz` consumes on Apple silicon.
#
# Usage:
#   bash tools/inventory-gates.sh          # rewrite docs/gate-fleet-inventory.md
#   bash tools/inventory-gates.sh --check  # spec-order + locale invariance.
#                                          # Does NOT fail when the tracked
#                                          # snapshot drifts: requiring every
#                                          # spec PR to commit this file made
#                                          # parallel PRs conflict on a
#                                          # generated table. The fleet source
#                                          # of truth is tools/gate/fleet.sh.
#   just inventory-gates [--check]
#
# Deterministic by construction: no dates, no revisions, no host state, and
# -- since issue #1177 -- a LOCALE PIN, so a fresh render on a clean tree is
# byte-identical in every environment.
#
# --check also runs the spec-shape guard (claim #1193) over
# tools/gate/specs/*.spec: see check_spec_order below.
#
# Locale pin (issue #1177): the render used to depend on the ambient locale.
# `cut -c1-100` counts BYTES under LC_ALL=C (the common macOS shell default
# for scripts) but CHARACTERS under a UTF-8 locale, so a header containing a
# non-ASCII character -- e.g. live-m21-persist-title-orphan.spec's em dash --
# rendered differently in the two environments: `--check` failed for whoever
# was not in the same locale as the author, and `[[:space:]]` in the trailing
# sed was locale-sensitive too. LC_ALL=C is now pinned for the whole render
# (byte-deterministic sorting/comparison), and header truncation is done by
# `truncate_chars` in UTF-8 CHARACTERS rather than bytes -- byte truncation
# can also split a multi-byte sequence and write invalid UTF-8 into a tracked
# markdown file. `--check` additionally asserts render equality across two
# locales, so a future locale-sensitive operation cannot creep back in.

# check_spec_order -- spec-shape guard (claim #1193).
#
# `exec` LOADS a program and SPAWNS it, then returns: it does not wait for the
# program to run, let alone finish. A boot script that launches a program while
# an earlier one is still starting has therefore lost whatever ordering it
# assumed, even though the serial log looks interleaved-but-complete. That
# landed as a real bug in live-oliver (#1188): `exec OLIVER.BIN`, then a
# `vf rm` in the same script, raced the first program's write and the gate
# reported the file as missing.
#
# The two mechanically detectable shapes are checked here:
#
#   ungated-echo-end    the run's `--script-expect` marker is one the SCRIPT
#                       supplies, and no stage gate anchors the run on guest
#                       output (`--script-after` / `--script2-after` /
#                       `--script3-after` / `--input-string-after` with at
#                       least one marker no script in the run supplies). The
#                       runner stops the VM on that echo, so a program launched
#                       by the same script can still be coming up while
#                       assertions are evaluated.
#   file-op-after-exec  a `vf <verb>` file-channel operation follows an `exec`
#                       in the same script, so it can race that program's own
#                       writes (the #1188 shape exactly).
#
# A spec may state why such a shape is safe in its header:
#
#   # exec-order: <class> -- <reason>
#
# with <class> one of:
#   intentional      the author vouches for the ordering and says why -- the
#                    bucket for a provable case the parser cannot see, e.g. an
#                    exec whose binary does not exist, so the refusal is
#                    synchronous and no program is ever running
#   self-sequenced   the script itself blocks on the program (`fg N`, the
#                    only blocking job verb the guest shell has), so the echo
#                    cannot precede the program's completion
#   timeout-ordered  the run is bounded by --timeout and its asserts are
#                    order-independent (they need no program output at all)
#   assert-proven    the run ends on a script echo, but its asserts read
#                    output only the program produces, so the stop trigger
#                    is not what makes the run green -- a program that never
#                    ran still fails the run (this shape can flake late; it
#                    cannot pass unproven)
#
# The class must be one of those four (a typo cannot silently exempt a spec),
# and declared exemptions are printed so they stay visible in CI output.
#
# check_spec_order [DIR] -- DIR defaults to tools/gate/specs. The --check
