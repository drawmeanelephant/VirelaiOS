# go-selftest.spec -- M61b/M61c/M61d/M61e (issues #1382/#1383/#1384/#1385)
# class-B gate: the first guest-owned pass/fail in the fleet. GOSELF.ELF runs a
# built-in case list on the fixtures the host seeded under IN/, writes
# /host/SELFTEST/REPORT.txt + OUT/ receipts on the share, then prints the
# serial contract of ADR 0031 (`selftest: FAIL n=<N>`, `selftest OK`).
#
# Serial is the heartbeat; the files are the proof. The load-bearing asserts
# read $VG_SHARE on the HOST, so an app that printed `selftest: FAIL n=0`
# without writing the report cannot pass. The run ends on the program's own
# summary marker (SPEC.md idiom 1): a run whose summary never appears fails on
# the expect deadline.
#
# The intake cases (M61c) are the anti-embedding test. The host seeds two
# fixtures with DIFFERENT bodies (IN/fixture.txt = the canonical bytes,
# IN/altered.txt = the same bytes with one character changed) and the guest
# copies the bytes it actually READ into OUT/. An app that answered from a
# constant compiled into the binary cannot pass this: the copies would not
# match the files macOS holds in the share, and `intake-altered` — which must
# find the altered body, not the canonical one — would report the wrong bytes.
#
# The END-TO-END mutation form of ADR 0031 D2 (rewrite IN/fixture.txt itself,
# watch `intake` FAIL) was run once during M61c and is recorded on issue #1383:
# seed IN/fixture.txt with the altered bytes in the setup hook below and the run
# must end on `case intake fail fixture mismatch: got=25 want=25` +
# `selftest: FAIL n=1`. It is deliberately not a second boot in this spec — the
# mismatch path is regression-tested off-guest (`go test ./selftest`,
# TestIntakeFailsOnAMutatedSeed) and the anti-embedding property is what the
# asserts here cover continuously.
#
# M61d (#1384) adds the file-ABI pack, all of it on the share under per-case
# paths: create/write/close/reopen/read-back, truncate-then-read,
# delete-then-reopen-fails, and a directory listing that sees a file and then
# does not. Each case leaves TWO pieces of host-readable evidence — a one-line
# `case <id> …` receipt and, where bytes came back, a `.copy` of the bytes it
# READ (never the bytes it intended) — and the asserts below byte-compare all of
# it. A case that printed a verdict without landing the bytes cannot pass.
#
# The M61d cases are checked twice, on purpose. The receipts are the guest's
# claim about itself; the block below ALSO reads the share's own directory state
# on macOS (OUT/deleted.txt absent, OUT/LIST empty, roundtrip.txt 525 B,
# truncate.txt holding exactly the reconstructed 105-byte prefix). Those are
# facts about the filesystem the guest's syscalls left behind, which no receipt
# can fake — and the reconstructed bodies come from the same one-expression
# units the app writes (`b"goself file abi line\n" * n`), not from a fixture
# file. A `.copy` that does not equal the reconstruction fails the gate.
#
# M61e (#1385) adds the window receipt. Its evidence file is the only one whose
# bytes depend on a RUNTIME value (the id the kernel assigned), so it is matched
# rather than fixed — and then held to the two reporters of that same window
# that are NOT this process:
#
#   * the KERNEL's own open record, `open: id=<N> owner=<pid> rect=<x>,<y>
#     <W>x<H> ws=<k>` (driving_award.zig, the open-attribution marker of issue
#     #990), which also gives the rect as REQUESTED — 32,32 640x400, the app's
#     tabapp.Config;
#   * TABWM's `tabwm: tab-switch idx=<i> id=<N>` line, the WM naming the tab it
#     made active.
#
# The receipt's `win=` must equal both ids, and its `w=`/`h=` must be the
# tab-aware CONTENT VIEWPORT the WM proposed (1100x720 at x=180 — tabwm's
# compute_tab_viewport) rather than the 640x400 the kernel logged at open. That
# last point is what makes the window case worth a boot: a case that restated
# its own request would report 640x400, a number the kernel's open line
# contains, and fail here. The geometry in the receipt therefore comes from
# sys_win_query's read-back of the kernel's window record — a kernel->user copy
# into a fresh buffer, the same path issue #1391 broke and ADR 0032 fixed.
#
# This is NOT a framebuffer golden (the card's non-goal): no pixels are read
# anywhere, no PNG is compared, and nothing in the case knows what the window
# looks like.
#
# M81b (#1762) adds the `mime` case: the file-type table, proved on the share.
# The case WRITES seven fixtures under OUT/MIME/ and READS each one back
# through the file ABI before sniffing it, so the receipt describes bytes that
# came back over the share rather than a constant in the binary. The row that
# carries the card is README.TXT — PNG magic under a .TXT name, reported as
# `image`: magic decides before the extension ever does. The assert below
# byte-compares the receipt AND reads OUT/MIME/ from the host, so a case that
# printed a plausible table without landing the bytes cannot pass.
#
# REGRESSION TEST for #1391 (fixed in the kernel, ADR 0032): the first
# kernel->user copy into a user buffer whose pages EL0 has never written used to
# be silently lost on VZ — the syscall reported the right byte count and the app
# read zeros, because the destination page still resolved for EL1 into the
# kernel's EL1-only identity overlay. The guest's read helper does not touch its
# buffer first (that workaround is deleted), and `intake` reads a host-seeded
# fixture into a fresh buffer; the asserts below require the fixture bytes
# back — in the report, in the OUT/ copies and in the receipts. With the defect
# live, this run ended on `case intake fail read returned 25B of zeros (issue
# #1391)` + `selftest: FAIL n=1` (recorded on #1391). The host's file channel
# was never involved (its stdout shows the bytes served). The M61d read-backs
# and M61e's win_query land in fresh buffers on the same path.
#
# This spec is also the PILOT for the two share-assert kinds added by M61f
# (#1386), the only amendment to tools/gate/SPEC.md since M40 GF2: REPORT.txt
# and the host-seeded IN/fixture.txt are checked with `share-equals` (a
# byte-exact compare against a vgate_file fixture, with the compared share file
# lifted into evidence automatically) and the guest's own summary with
# `share-contains`. The two were proven both ways on VZ before landing — a
# deliberately truncated `report.expected` reddens the run naming share-equals,
# and an unarmed share FAILs rather than skipping (recorded on #1386).
#
# M66a (#1443) extends the file-ABI pack with the hardening semantics, each
# one the ADR 0031 way (guest writes receipts + the bytes it READ, the host
# byte-compares them here on macOS):
#
#   * file-append    — write a base body, REOPEN with MODE_APPEND (no
#                      create), write more: the append write must land at
#                      EOF, so append.txt is base+more (105 B). A dropped
#                      append flag replaces the file and the read-back is
#                      the delta alone.
#   * file-bigwrite  — a 73,500-byte body, far beyond the kernel's
#                      2048-byte sys_file_write stage cap: it only lands
#                      through the confirmed-count chunk loop, and
#                      bigwrite.txt + bigwrite.copy must be byte-exact.
#   * file-clamp     — write 840 B, shrink the SAME handle to 105 B, write
#                      63 B more through the still-open handle: the host's
#                      truncate clamps its cursor, so clamp.txt is kept+extra
#                      (168 B). Without the clamp the write resumes past EOF
#                      and the read-back is neither the length nor the bytes.
#   * file-fsync     — the durability verb (slot 77, ADR 0007 amendment):
#                      fsync=0 on the open handle, closed=-2 (the honest
#                      EBADF) on the closed one; fsync.txt is byte-compared.
#   * file-errors    — the honest error rows, each observed on the share:
#                      missing=-6 (ENOENT), exists=-9 (the file-domain
#                      EEXIST row), isdir=-1 (a WRITE open of a directory),
#                      ninth=-5 (the 8-handle table full).
#
#   * file-write-safe — the publish primitive the M81e (#1765) app
#                      conversions stand on: a long body replaced by a
#                      short one. The read-back is exactly the short
#                      body (a whole-file publish, no tail) and the
#                      sacrificial temp does not survive, so the share
#                      holds one file and no orphan.
#
#   * file-snapshot — the M81g (#1767) snapshot bundle, the DRILL the
#                      card is about. The host seeds four inputs under
#                      IN/ (a settings table, a BINARY session strip, two
#                      documents); the guest carries them into one bundle,
#                      publishes it through the safe write, reads it back,
#                      parses it and republishes every entry under
#                      OUT/RESTORED/. The host then rebuilds the bundle
#                      FROM ITS OWN SEEDED BODIES and byte-compares, so
#                      what is verified is a round trip through the
#                      container rather than the guest agreeing with
#                      itself — and it re-parses the published bundle with
#                      an INDEPENDENT reader, which is what makes the
#                      format self-describing instead of guest-private.
#                      The binary session body is the load-bearing part: a
#                      text-only container could not carry a real strip.
#                      The receipt's `corrupt=refused` is the refusal half,
#                      and a one-byte-short bundle must never parse.
#   * file-write-publish — the seam BOTH shell hooks now call (M81e2
#                      #1787): vi.WriteFilePublish's two contracts. The
#                      REPLACE half is the GOSH history ring save and `>
#                      file` (a long body replaced by a short one, no
#                      tail, no orphan temp). The APPEND half is the
#                      history one-line append and `>>`, and it must ADD
#                      to the file rather than rewrite it — so the
#                      read-back is the whole base-plus-lines body
#                      byte-compared, not a "the new line is present"
#                      contains, which a rewrite-per-line
#                      implementation would also pass.
#
#   * trash — the M81a (#1761) recoverable-delete flow. The guest reads the
#             trashed bytes, restores them to the original path, records both
#             actions in RECENT, and expires an old item at the retention
#             boundary. The host checks the bytes, receipt, trash directory
#             state and recent action order.
#
# The report fixture below is byte-exact on purpose — the report is
# deterministic (ADR 0031). Adding a case updates the fixture, the
# share-contains case count, and want_summary in the python block.
#
# HOST PREREQUISITE (fails the gate honestly when missing):
