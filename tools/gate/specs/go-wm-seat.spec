# go-wm-seat.spec -- M57a/b/c (issues #1313/#1317/#1318) class-B gate: a Go WM
# (GOTABWM.ELF) registers the kernel render-server seat (slot 65), composites a
# blank desktop, manages its OWN Go windows, and HOSTS GOCALC.ELF (M62h)
# plus NOTE.ELF (M66c; the Zig notepad it replaced is deleted in #1485).
#
# M57a: REGISTER (slot 65 cmd 1), the seam-B scanout grant, and a REQUEST_PRESENT
# loop paced by the kind-18 COMPOSITE_TICK. M57b: the seat's own window
# lifecycle (open, chrome descriptor, a kernel-clamped rect, focus/blur, a
# WM-seam close, the client-death probe). M57c: interop — GOCALC.ELF
# discovers the seat by process name, declares over the WM_RPC
# mailbox, and is focused, given the full viewport, and closed by the seat.
# Zig CALC.BIN is gone (M62h / #1406).
#
# One headless boot arms the GPU, execs GOTABWM.ELF, queries the seat and the
# window registry while both are live, execs GOCALC.ELF under it, and lets the
# program exit cleanly (the kernel unregisters the seat, falling back to the
# shim). Serial markers are the proof; each is printed only after its syscall
# returned.
#
# M59 (issue #1298) note: the COMPILED default is now the Go seat, so this
# spec seeds `wm=none` in its share to keep what it actually proves -- the
# seat's explicit, opt-in registration path -- separate from the default flip
# (go-wm-default.spec owns that). Its "shim at boot" asserts are therefore
# about the seeded setting, not about the out-of-the-box boot.
# M63f (#1463): re-verified green after GOTABWM maxTicks 90 (M73z;
# was 48). No HID here.
#
# HOST PREREQUISITE (fails the gate honestly when missing):
#   bash tools/go/build-gotabwm.sh   ->  .build/go/GOTABWM.ELF
#   bash tools/go/build-gocalc.sh    ->  .build/go/GOCALC.ELF
#
# M79k (#1720) adds run 06: the notify seam. GOFILES.ELF is the adopter (it
# raises a toast on a completed copy, over the real WM_RPC kind-12 frame, to
# a LIVE seat); the run proves the whole chain — the app's own ack, the
# seat's queue line, a kind-4 snapshot of the toast ON the composed scanout
# (exact-RGB, straight out of the guest), and a `--pointer-virtio` click on
# the toast that dismisses it and focuses the sender.
#
# exec-order: assert-proven -- each run ends on a marker only its script prints
# (`rx-gotabwm-ok`, `rx-gotabwm-np-ok`, `rx-gotabwm-chrome-ok`), and every stage
# gate waits on guest output the program, the kernel and the hosted app produce
# (`gotabwm: win focus`, `gotabwm: present`, `wm: unregistered, shim resumed`).
#
# M71c (#1562) adds run 03: the seat's OWN clock/status chrome, on an EMPTY
# strip. Run 01/02 host a full-viewport client that the kernel repaints every
# tick, which covers the bottom-right panel; with no client exec'd the panel is
# the seat's last write and is stable in the capture. The capture is timed to
# `gotabwm: present` because the tick loop is paint -> chromeTick -> present, so
# that marker is the first moment the frame is both painted and flushed
# (capturing on `gotabwm: clock` races the flush and reads a black resource --
# measured 2026-09-21).
# M66c (#1445 retarget, #1485 retirement): the client is NOTE.ELF, the Go
# successor to the Zig notepad, and the Zig binary itself is now GONE. The
# lifecycle vocabulary is shared by design (`note:` mirrors `notepad:`), so the
# assertions below moved by prefix alone. The coverage that app alone had moved
# to GOEDIT.ELF (find/goto, the unsaved-decline contract) or GOCOMP.ELF (its
# clipboard+timer composition); the theme-token boots were retired with it.
#
# HOST PREREQUISITE: bash tools/go/build-note.sh -> .build/go/NOTE.ELF
#
# M79a (#1704): the seat is LIVE by default -- no run budget, no auto-close,
# no strip choreography. The bounded M57-era demo is DEMO mode, opted in by
# the PRESENCE of /host/GOTABWM.DEMO; the setup below seeds it so runs 01-04
# drive exactly the choreography they always have. Run 05 REMOVES the trigger
# before exec and proves the product default: the loop ticks PAST the demo
# ceiling (maxTicks 90) with the tab still open, nothing ever says `host
# done`/`tab close`, and the run ends by KILLING the seat -- process exit,
# which still unwinds through the kernel's exit seam (`wm: unregistered`).

# --- M79k (#1720) run 06: the notify seam, end to end ---------------------
#
# GOFILES.ELF is the adopter: it raises a toast on a COMPLETED copy, over the
# real WM_RPC wire, to a seat that is LIVE (the GOTABWM.DEMO trigger is
# removed before the exec, the go-wm-seat run 05 pattern — in demo mode the
# single-tab hostTicks countdown closes the app long before an 8-tick toast
# could expire on its own).
#
# The chain this run proves has five links, each with its own marker,
# because each can fail alone:
#
#   gofiles: pasted SOURCE.TXT         the copy really completed
#   gofiles: notify sent <text>        the app's OWN ack — the seat
#                                       answered, so this is not a request
#                                       into the void
#   gotabwm: notify id=<n> <text>      the seat queued it (printed AFTER
#                                       the push, never before)
#   gotabwm: notify paint id=<n>       the toast is ON THE SCANOUT and
#                                       the frame was PRESENTED
#   gotabwm: notify dismiss id=<n>     the toast click took it away and
#                                       focused its sender
#   gotabwm: notify center paint       the history center was presented
#   gotabwm: notify center dismiss    its row control removed one item
#
# The pixel probe is a kind-4 snapshot fired on `notify paint`, not a host
# framebuffer grab: the guest streams its own composed scanout, so the
# pixels ARE the seat's, and the trigger marker is printed after the
# present — a grab keyed on `gotabwm: notify id=` would read a frame the
# seat had not flushed yet (the go-wm-seat run 03 note).
#
# The input is `--input-string $'jck\np'`, NOT `--input-chords`, and the
# difference is load-bearing. GOFILES is a tty app: it reads bytes from its
# bound /dev/tty and decodes them with keys.Decode. An ARROW arrives as a
# single HID usage (0x51/0x52) that the kernel expands into the three tty
# bytes ESC [ B — and over the cv-input transport (0.25 s per stroke) that
# expansion is not atomic: the ESC is delivered and decoded on its own, so
# `keys.Decode` returns KeyEsc and the app runs goUp() instead of moving the
# selection. That is exactly what the first attempt at this run did — the
# app climbed to /host, opened APPS.TXT, and pasted into the share root
# (observed 2026-09-26: `gofiles: cd /host`, `gofiles: view APPS.TXT`,
# `gofiles: paste refused APPS.TXT exists`, and no toast at all). The vi keys
# j/k do the same move WITHOUT a CSI sequence — one printable byte, decoded
# as a rune — so the whole batch is five printable bytes and one Enter:
#
#   j  move down one entry      0 -> 1  (SOURCE.TXT)
#   c  yank a COPY of it        `gofiles: clip copy SOURCE.TXT`
#   k  move up one entry        1 -> 0  (SUB)
#  \n  open the selection       `gofiles: cd /host/NOTIFY/SUB`
#   p  paste                    `gofiles: pasted SOURCE.TXT` + the toast
#
# The first click is a `--pointer-virtio` press+release at the toast's centre,
# (112, 702) = the middle of notifyRect(1280,720,0) = (8, 692, 208, 20). It
# then opens the center from the clock/status panel, selects the sender, and
# presses that row's X control. The sequence is scheduled on the PAINT marker,
# not on the request marker, so the toast is provably on the scanout when the
# first pointer edge arrives. The seat's tick is ~1 s, NotifyTicks is 8, and
# pointer transport paces 2.5 s per message.
#
# exec-order: assert-proven -- the run ends on `rx-gotabwm-notify-ok`, which
# only script3 prints, and script3 is held behind the center's row-dismiss
# marker, which only the seat's notification-center action can print.

# is the ANSWER to that request, so the app cannot claim the user was told
# before the seat had queued anything), the queue line before the paint (the
# paint marker is printed after the push), and the paint before the dismiss
# (run 06's click is anchored on the paint marker, so the toast was on screen
# before anything dismissed it). One sender id throughout: the toast belongs
# to the tab that raised it.
#
# `sent` and `painted` are deliberately NOT ordered against each other. Both
# are downstream of `queued` with nothing causal in between: the seat prints
# `queued` while servicing the request and paints on the next presented tick,
# while the app prints `sent` when the ack makes the mailbox round trip back.
# Which lands first is a scheduling race. An earlier version of this hook
# asserted sent < painted and failed on a rebuild that changed nothing about
