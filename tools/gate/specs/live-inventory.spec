# live-inventory.spec -- M22 D16: which + inventory on VZ.
# Resolves all three command classes (builtin, monitor, app) + not-found,
# and inventory lists APPS.TXT applications.
#
# M66c (#1445): the dock's editor entry is NOTE.ELF now, so `image/apps.txt`
# (which gate-run copies in as the share's APPS.TXT) names it and the app query
# follows. NOTE.ELF is a staged Go ELF, not a seeded .BIN, hence the setup that
# copies it into the share.
#
# HOST PREREQUISITE: bash tools/go/build-note.sh -> .build/go/NOTE.ELF

# M82a (#1768): the manifest and the share are the same catalog, and the
# kernel's `inventory` is the guest's own view of it. The check runs over the
# INVENTORY BLOCK of the log (header to the run's own `rx-inv-ok`), not the
# whole serial, so a name cannot be satisfied by an unrelated boot message.
# A manifest row that exists in this share must be a file the guest listed:
# a row naming a file the guest cannot see is a row the launcher would offer
# and then fail to exec, which is the class of lie this card exists to stop.
# Rows NOT staged in this gate are counted and reported, never silently
# skipped — this spec stages one Go ELF, so most of the catalog is absent by
# design.
