# go-dogfood.spec -- M69a (issue #1528) class-B gate: the daily-driver beat on
# the DEFAULT Go seat (no `wm` override anywhere in this spec).
#
# Two boots, one beat. Each boot stages a slice of the beat's apps on the same
# default seat, and each slice is phase-gated: the harness forwards the next
# `exec` only after the previous app's own marker says it was HOSTED, so the
# serial order is the beat order and not the scheduler's. The six markers are
# printed by guest programs -- the seat and the apps themselves -- so no staged
# line and no harness echo can produce one (D2).
#
#   boot 01   first-boot GOSH -> exec NOTE.ELF      seat, gosh, note, ok
#   boot 02   exec GOCALC.ELF -> exec WEB.ELF PAGE  seat, calc, page, ok
#
# WHY TWO BOOTS, not one (both limits observed in-tree, neither invented here):
#
#  1. The runner forwards at most THREE command phases per boot (`--script`,
#     `--script2`, `--script3`, each released by its own `-after` marker --
#     host/vm-runner/Sources/VMRunner/main.swift). Four phase-gated execs need
#     four phases. Putting two execs in one phase would leave their declare
#     order to the scheduler, and an ordered assert on a race is a flake, not
#     evidence.
#  2. The seat's PROVEN envelope is three Go runtimes: itself plus two clients
#     (M65d / #1442: 3 kernel + 3x4 Ms + 1 spare; see the maxTicks note in
#     user/go/gotabwm/seat.go). That is an envelope, not a documented failure --
#     four live Go runtimes have not been tried, and #1449 is the record of a
#     different shape entirely (a THIRD SEQUENTIAL exec from one EL0 parent,
#     which M70c-S2 then measured as unreproduced at its head). So each boot
#     stages two client apps, which is also the shape go-wm-default (one app)
#     and go-wm-tabs (two) already prove. Reason 1 alone is a hard limit; this
#     one is the conservative choice inside a proven envelope, and is labelled
#     as such rather than cited as a wall.
#
# The beat is therefore a tour of the default seat: shell+editor together,
# then calculator+browser together. All four apps, one seat, same share.
#
# What each marker actually proves -- stated precisely, because the obvious
# reading of the app markers is stronger than the wire supports:
#
#   dogfood: seat   the seat's own line, after registration AND the one-seat
#                   probe returned: the DEFAULT seat owns the desktop.
#   dogfood: gosh   the APP, on its accepted-declare path only. Read this for
#   dogfood: note   what it is: the seat ANSWERED the declare with the ack's
#   dogfood: calc   applied bit set, i.e. a WM seat is there and the app is on
#                   it -- NOT proof that a tab opened. gotabwm's applyRPC acks
#                   applied=1 on this path whether or not tabs.OpenTab took
#                   (interop.go), and the app cannot see the difference, so
#                   these three lines must not be asked to carry the hosting.
#   dogfood: page   WEB, once, on the first frame of a LAID-OUT page reaching
#                   the scanout -- the page rendered.
#   dogfood: ok     the seat's host-done line, printed only when this boot
#                   actually hosted a tab: the dogfoodHosted latch is set by a
#                   successful tabs.OpenTab alone (interop.go).
#
# HOSTING is therefore pinned where the kernel-side truth lives: the seat's own
# `gotabwm: tab open id=` counter, asserted at TWO per boot below -- the idiom
# go-wm-tabs.spec uses for the same two-tab property. Without that count the
# gate could regress to one hosted app per boot and still pass, since one tab
# sets the latch that `dogfood: ok` hangs on and every app marker above would
# still fire.
#
# The browser is attached with WM_RPC kind 5 (attach), not kind 8
# (declare_fullscreen), so the page keeps the 512x384 geometry the live-web
# gates pin. Attach is what makes the page VISIBLE here: the seat paints the
# blank desktop only while its strip is empty, and that compose-N fill sits
# ABOVE user windows -- an undeclared browser would be silently overpainted.
#
# HOST PREREQUISITE (fails the gate honestly when missing):
#   bash tools/go/build-gotabwm.sh        ->  .build/go/GOTABWM.ELF
#   bash tools/go/build-gosh.sh           ->  .build/go/GOSH.ELF
#   bash tools/go/build-note.sh           ->  .build/go/NOTE.ELF

#   bash tools/go/build-web.sh browser    ->  .build/go/WEB.ELF (the name the
#                                             app claims to the WM; the script
#                                             defaults it now)
#   bash tools/go/build-goterm.sh         ->  .build/go/GOTERM.ELF    (boot 04)
#   bash tools/go/build-charmhello.sh     ->  .build/go/CHARMHELLO.ELF (boot 04)
#   bash tools/go/build-files.sh          ->  .build/go/GOFILES.ELF   (boots 05/06)
#   (the page is the pinned fixture user/go/browser/testdata/gate-page.html,
#    staged as /host/DOGFOOD.HTML; no new fixture)
#
# M69b subscribes to the same six markers for its `--screenshot-after`; see
# docs/testing.md.
#
# M69g (#1558) adds a THIRD boot: GOSH ALONE on the same default Go seat,
# captured after a settle, with a PIXEL assert on its first terminal line.
# The two boots above are marker-only by design; a tab that renders nothing is
# invisible to every one of them, which is exactly how #1558 escaped. Boot 03
# is the falsifiable half — the seed, the seat and the shell are the same, and
# only GOSH is hosted, so the captured frame's tab region is the shell's own
# pixels and nothing else.
#
# M73z (#1638) adds a FOURTH boot: the M73 milestone acceptance, one boot in
# which the default seat drives the whole terminal promise as a user would:
# (a) Enter-summon + the docked Terminal entry (apps.txt:8, dock=true) through
# the launcher -> M73c's honest goterm: markers; (b) a staged share script's
# rows (box-drawing + wide rune, paste >256 B) drag-selected and pushed back
# through GOTERM's bound tty with Ctrl+Shift+C/V (M73e's exact chain) -> every
# line runs; (c) its clear+redraw burst followed by the monitor `tty` line
# reading 0/0 (M73f-1 polarity + M73f-2's line, after the burst settles);
# (d) a LIVE resize -> charmhello's own `charmhello: size` with the NEW
# cells + repaint (M73j — there is no window-edge drag seam under the
# seat: no kernel resize grip, no gotabwm gesture, and the monitor's
# `dui kresize` moves the rect WITHOUT notifying the owner
# (resize_window_keyboard emits no WIN_RESIZE; driving_award.zig:3078
# vs user_resize:1977 — observed serial-04: kresize marker, zero size
# markers after), so the card's "whichever the spec pick supports"
# picks M73j's OWN proven owner seam: one `r` keydown ->
# vi.WinResize(512x384 -> 64x23, go-charmhello's green path) — with
# `r` delivered by --input-key ANCHORED on the seat's own
# `gotabwm: alt-tab id=4` marker, because the seat drains WM_KEY one
# event per composite tick: an in-list `r` 0.25 s behind alt-tab
# reaches the kernel BEFORE focus moves (observed serial-04: the `r`
# fanned at 2002, the pin step forced focus 3 later, zero
# charmhello key markers));
# (e) the captured scanout pixel-asserts
# the rune row's box cells, the wide rune's cell pair, and no ink past col 79
# (M73a-2 + M73g's width wall) at the END of the sequence. Staging rides the
# STARTUP.SH contract (host-side file, silent run before GOTERM's first
# prompt — the serial line cap is 256 B, so a >256 B line cannot be staged
# through the console), and the phases mirror go-wm-hid's proven input set
# (`--via-virtio` alone). The pick of this spec over live-term-depth is
# evidence-made: live-term-depth boots WITHOUT GOTABWM by design (M73d
# geometry, header), so the launcher half cannot exist there; only this spec
# has the default seat + staging + snapshot shape. STARTUP.SH is shared by
# all four boots on purpose: boot 03's pixel pin counts terminal-green pixels
# in row 0 and the first staged row is a dense ASCII echo, so the assertion
# still measures green ink, not a prompt.
#
# M82d2 (#1785) adds boots 05 and 06: the notifications center's POLICY, on the
# LIVE default seat (the demo trigger is removed between boots 04 and 05 -- see
# the hook there). Boot 05 is a user's away-from-keyboard sequence: an app
# raises a toast (GOFILES, a completed copy), the user opens the center and
# turns do-not-disturb ON from its header, the same app raises a SECOND notice
# and it is HELD -- acked to the app, kept in the center's history, never
# painted as a toast. Boot 06 restarts the seat on the same share: the DND
# choice and both notices are still there, restored before the first paint,
# and the reopened center shows them. GOTABWM.DEMO's removal is what makes the
# seat live; nothing else about the default seat is overridden (still no `wm`
# row anywhere). The corrupt-history half of the card is go-wm-default's
# boots 13-16.
#
# exec-order: assert-proven -- every phase gate is anchored on guest output
# (the seat's, an app's, or the kernel's own marker: dogfood: seat ->
# user-el0 reaped -> gotabwm: present (the seat's own first present, reached
# only once NOTE's user window created render demand — boot 04's string
# phase fires here, go-wm-hid's chords fire on this same marker);
# goterm: prompt / dui: term sel end / goterm: done status=0 /
# charmhello: ready are all program markers), and the run ends on
# `charmhello: repainted` — a marker only charmhello prints after
# ActionResized, so a program that never ran still fails the run.

# --- boot 03: the shell tab's PIXELS on the default seat (M69g, #1558) ------
# Same compiled default seat, same share, GOSH alone. The capture is released
# by a MONITOR echo 4 s after `gosh: prompt` (the M69b recipe: the prompt is
# written to the tty, and the compositor paints it on the next composite), so
# the frame holds a settled tab rather than the boot frame.
#
# What the marker asserts is the geometry, not just "it ran": GOSH declares
# full-viewport, so its window is the whole scanout, and the kernel draws a
# window-bound terminal's grid starting at its title-band height (16 device
# rows). The shell's fresh prompt is therefore the ONLY text on the first
# grid line, at device y 16..31 (M73l #1661: cell_h=16 — was 16..23 at
# 8px cells). Before the #1558 fix GOTABWM's own 96x64
# client-death probe window (8,8,96,64) painted its chrome over that band and
# the region held no terminal-green pixels at all (measured: 55, all of it
# anti-aliasing from the probe's own white title text); with the fix it holds
# the prompt (measured: 578 across repeats).

# --- boot 04: THE M73 ACCEPTANCE (M73z, #1638) ------------------------------
# One boot, the default seat, the user's actual sequence. Every phase chains
# off a guest-printed marker:
#   user-el0 reaped -> script-04a: GOMAXPROCS + exec NOTE.ELF + the stage
#                     marker. NOTE is the seat's wake-up call: its USER
#                     window (owner>1) creates render demand, so the kernel
#                     starts the composite-tick cadence and the seat reaches
#                     `gotabwm: present` (observed run 1: a boot with no
#                     user window ever — the kernel demo id2 is owner=1 —
#                     sits at tick=0/present=0 forever and no input phase
#                     can be trusted to land). NOTE declares as the rail's
#                     ONLY tab (boot 03's tag-03 assert above deletes
#                     SESSION.TABS between runs: restored ids are
#                     placeholders that are not kernel windows, so
#                     closeHosted would fail on them and the strip could
#                     never empty), arming the seat's own 16-tick hostTicks
#                     choreography: with n==1 it counts down, then
#                     closeHosted closes NOTE's real id and prints
#                     `gotabwm: host close id=` + `gotabwm: tab close id=`
#                     (tabs.go / interop.go). Only then is the strip empty
#                     for the Enter-summon below. `exec` returns to the prompt
#                     (go-wm-hid run 03: `virelai>` prints right after its
#                     `exec GOTABWM.ELF`), so the shell idle loop — which
#                     is what pumps the queue-3 completions into
#                     input.decode_keyboard_report (main.zig claim 9588) —

#                     (apps.txt:8) and execs it — the same handleWmKey
#                     handlers go-wm-hid proves live via chords after

#                     same EvWmKey fan at the kernel. GOTERM reuses NOTE's
#                     freed slot (driving_award scans first-free ids), so

#                     SD5 kernel selection -> `dui: term sel end`). The
#                     window IS fullscreen: the serial pins BOTH
#                     `open: id=3 rect=64,48 640x400` (the exec) and then
#                     `gotabwm: host view id=3` — the seat's declare
#                     handler proposes the full viewport and
#                     SetWindowRect(0,0,1280,720) returned 0 (interop.go;
#                     asserted in the chain below from after launcher
#                     open, so it is GOTERM's proposal, not NOTE's). That

#                     empirically (a 64,48-based drag landed row4/col8);
#                     this run's `dui` dump is the authority: `dui[6]:
#                     user rect=0,0,1280,720 owner=3` — origin 0,0.
#                     title_bar_h=16 (wnd_core.zig), cell 8x16
#                     (font_metrics): content top = 16, so the five
#                     staged rows occupy y16..95 and prompt row 5
#                     y96..111.
#                     press (4,28)=row0col0 — y28 clears BOTH the title
#                     band (y0..15) and the seat's 22px rail band
#                     (RailHeight=22, tabs.go) — release (636,84) =
#                     row4col79 selects lines 0..4 = 274 B > 256 and
#                     stops above the prompt row so no PS1 text joins
#                     the selection. Geometry was NEVER the blocker:
#                     observed serial-04 had the press forwarded
#                     (`gotabwm: ptr` x7) with zero sel markers because
#                     CHARMHELLO's fullscreen face sat TOPMOST and its
#                     M73i mouse capture (?1000/?1006) makes
#                     mouseOwnsAt true there — mouse reports, never
#                     selection (`tty: paste 0 bytes`). The pointer
#                     phase is therefore gated on `charmhello: ready`
#                     and opens with the rail click, which RAISES
#                     GOTERM above charmhello before the press.
#                     script3
#                     fires on this same marker: `exec CHARMHELLO.ELF`

# --- (e) THE pixel proof: the pasted line's cells at the END of the run ------
# The pasted `clear` wiped the screen and the pasted rune row re-printed at
# row 0. Charmhello full-screen-declares like every rail app (boot 03's
# passing green pin at y17..29 is the z-order evidence: a focused
# fullscreen declare sits on top of the id2 demo window), so script2's
# `dui lower 4` — z-order only — drops it BEHIND GOTERM; script2 runs ON
# `charmhello: size 64x23` (the `r` resize, which prints size+repaint
# first), so `dui lower: lowered=4` is strictly AFTER both — the
# screenshot/expect barrier. Charmhello also repaints on its host-view
# resize at startup, so `repainted` alone (or a startup size marker)
# would end the run before the paste.
# GOTERM declares full-viewport (kind 8) and the kernel draws a window
# terminal's grid from its 16-row title band, so the row's first 80 cells
# sit at device y16..31, x from 0 (the geometry boot 03's prompt pin
# proved for the same seat shape). The row is
#   [box \u250c\u2500\u2510 cells 0..2][wide \u4f60 cells 3..4][space cell 5][p... cell 6+]
# so: ink in the box span, ink across BOTH cells of the wide rune's pair, a
# BLANK cell where the wide rune's continuation must leave off, ink resuming
# at the exact next cell boundary, and NOTHING at or past col 79 (x>=640) —
# the alignment that fails if the wide rune ever consumed 1 cell (the gap
# would land at [32..40) and p's would start at x40, tripping the blank-cell
# and the past-wall pins at once). script3's `dui` dump records every window
# rect as geometry evidence; if another window ever covered this band the
