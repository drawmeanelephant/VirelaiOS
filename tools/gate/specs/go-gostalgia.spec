# go-gostalgia.spec -- M95b (#2010) + M95c (#2011) + M95f (#2014): the
# pinned Gostalgia tree built as a GOOS=virelai guest through the overlay
# mechanism. Run 01 is the M95b adapter gate (mem:// IPC, file primitives,
# sys_exec'd child, in-band shutdown) and is unchanged. Runs 02-04 are the
# M95c terminal backend gate: GOSTALGIA.ELF's Bubble Tea v1 shell on a
# GOTABWM-hosted window tty, driven by real HID keystrokes — never
# synthetic app input. Runs 06-07 are the M95f packaging gate: the
# APPS.TXT v2 row launched from the seat's own launcher over real HID,
# the hosted window on the strip + kernel registry with its title, and
# clean exit back to the desktop.
#
#   run 02: render + echo + typed `exit` -> status 0. `dui focus` is the
#           marker-gated refocus: the seat's own chrome windows (the Apps
#           button, blur probe) grab kernel focus at open — typing waits
#           for `dui focus: focused=3` so every key lands on the bound tty.
#   run 03: seat relayout resize + WIN_CLOSE. ctrl-shift-v cycles the
#           live seat's split (needs the staged CHARMHELLO tab), both
#           panes re-rect through wm_apply_rect -> WIN_RESIZE -> 80x21.
#   run 04: text-grid readback — kernel selection -> ctrl-shift-c copy ->
#           monitor `clip` — proves typed commands reached the shell and
#           its replies painted the grid; ctrl-c exits via the sig seam.
#   run 05: font-zoom resize — `font large` is the kernel's own WIN_RESIZE
#           delivery (M80i): the bound grid re-flows to the 10x21 rung and
#           the app re-reads TerminalCell — 80x44 -> 80x33.
#   run 06: launcher exec — ctrl-space + typed filter `gostalgia` + Return
#           over real HID runs the APPS.TXT v2 row's argv; `exit` typed on
#           the bound tty exits 0; a post-exit Enter on the emptied strip
#           re-opens the launcher (desktop took the keyboard back).
#   run 07: same launch, then the rail close-x click (rightmost 16 px of
#           the single cell, y<22) drives closeTabByID -> WmctlWinClose ->
#           WIN_CLOSE -> the same in-band shutdown seam -> status 0.
#   run 08: M95g acceptance (#2015) — the full guest journey in one cold
#           boot: seat -> launcher exec -> the marker-paced shell session
#           (launch + echo, dir + type on the seeded manifest, apps
#           LIVE/READY, a clipboard-pasted `call fs/read` byte channel)
#           -> a marker-triggered raw-framebuffer snapshot whose glyph
#           decode proves the seeded document byte-exact -> typed `exit`
#           -> status 0, window gone, focus on the desktop.
#
# HOST PREREQUISITE: `.build/go/GSSMOKE.ELF` and `.build/go/GOSTALGIA.ELF`
# via `bash tools/go/build-gostalgia.sh` (overlay leg; --no-overlay is the
# fail-before leg — the staged pin has no cmd/gssmoke and refuses).
#
# exec-order: assert-proven -- every run ends on markers only the exec'd
# program emits (`gostalgia: done`, `procs GOSTALGIA.ELF exited status=0`,
# `gssmoke: done`); no script-supplied echo gates a run's end.

#                        grabbed kernel focus at open; the restore is the

# Byte-exact document proof off the real framebuffer: the snapshot
# trigger fired on `call sys/ping ok` — after `cls` re-anchored the
# transcript, the pasted `call fs/read` reply, and every earlier leg —
# so the streamed 1280x720 BGRX frame shows the whole reply block.
# Each of the 42x76 content cells is glyph-decoded against the medium
# atlas staged at setup (binary ink mask, argmin Hamming over cp 32..126 —
# calibrated on a captured session: ~0.1 s, lossless on this palette).
# Row content only (cols 1..76): the lipgloss `│`/`─` frame cells are
# skipped structurally so their non-ASCII fallbacks cannot inject noise.
# Squashing every decoded row to the base64 alphabet rejoins the
# hard-wrapped payload seamlessly — the expected 296-char payload must be
# a literal substring, then its decode must equal the exact manifest
# bytes apps.SeedManifests writes at compose time
# (json.MarshalIndent(echo.Manifest()) + '\n', computed on the host).
