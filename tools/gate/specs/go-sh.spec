# go-sh.spec -- M68a (issue #1449) class-B gate: GOSH, the Go shell, hosts
# the M49 daily-use bar as a tabapp window in Zig TABWM. The seeded
# STARTUP.SH drives the scripting subset through the same engine a typed
# line uses: env/variables, one pipe, and > redirects (each read back ON
# THE HOST, byte-equal), a foreground exec whose status arrives through $?,
# and a background job cycled through jobs/fg. Then the harness types at
# the prompt: a fresh line, a Backspace edit, and a reverse-i-search recall
# edited by one character -- each visible as its own `gosh: line ` marker.
#
# HOST PREREQUISITE (fails the gate honestly when missing):
#   bash tools/go/build-gosh.sh   ->  .build/go/GOSH.ELF
#
# exec-order: assert-proven -- the run ends on `rx-gosh-ok`, which only the
# stage script prints, and the stage gate waits on `gosh: line echo ay`,
# which only the typed recall can produce; a shell that never ran cannot pass.

# M81e2 (#1787) added two lines to the startup script below, and they are
# the redirect decision pinned on the share. `>` is now a crash-safe
# publish, so `echo shrunk-body > /host/GOOSHSHRINK.TXT` runs against a body
# the setup hook seeded LONG (800 B) and must leave EXACTLY the 13 B new body
# -- the share-equals assert is byte-equal, so a surviving tail fails rather
# than passes. `echo first-appended >> /host/GOSHVARS.TXT` then appends to
# the redirect above, so GOSHVARS.TXT reads back as body-plus-one-line; an
# append that replaced would show only the appended line. Neither may leave
# a `~` temp beside it (the last python assert).
#
# NOTE for the next editor: do NOT put comments inside this heredoc. The
# startup block is a GUEST script run by shlib, where a leading `#` is a
# parse-level no-op but is still submitted as a line -- so it lands in the
# history ring and shifts the Up-arrow recall the typed-chord choreography
# so it lands in the history ring and changes the session history. Comments
# belong in this prose, above the heredoc.

# Seed one known history entry before GOSH opens its editor. The first live
# Up/Return is a transport probe: if the key path works, a non-empty history
# MUST submit this line. This separates a lost Up chord from an empty live
# history ring before the following typed-line history regression.

# The startup contract: STARTUP.SH (then PROFILE.SH, absent here) runs

# (no window, no tty, exits with the line's status). Two children, in this
# order: the foreground `exit 7` pins exec+wait status propagation through
# $?; the background `echo nested-child-ok` cycles the job table
# (jobs -> fg) AND proves a child's own console output reaches the serial
# log -- the old `sleep 2` there printed nothing, which is why the
# `nested-child-ok` assert below could never fire. A THIRD
# sequential exec from one EL0 parent currently dies in the Go runtime's
# own schedinit (observed twice: "refill of span with reusable pointers"
# -> fatal exit 2) -- surfaced by this card, documented on #1449, follow-up
