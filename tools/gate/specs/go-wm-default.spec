# go-wm-default.spec -- M59 (issue #1298) class-B gate: the boot-default flip.
#
# Boot 01 carries NO `wm` setting or SESSION.TABS: the compiled default seats
# GOTABWM.ELF and M76b opens its first-boot GOSH workspace before the settings
# and calculator runs. A marker and prompt-pixel capture pin the hosted
# terminal. Zig CALC.BIN is gone (M62h / #1406).
#
# M71f (#1565): the run then persists `wm=tabwm` FROM THE GO PANEL. GOSET.ELF
# is exec'd under the seat after the first-boot shell tab, typed into, and applies
# `wm=tabwm` with one command line -- the panel publishes it crash-safe. That is
# the card's premise repaired in place: on the DEFAULT seat, a Go UI changes the
# seat. Boot 01's publish includes the visible, accepted-but-unseeded
# idle_minutes default row; boot 04's kernel-side heal does not seed it.
# Boots 11/12 set a nondefault idle_minutes FROM GOSET and read it on reboot.
# M82d2 (#1785) adds the notifications policy's two persisted halves as boots
# 13-16: the do-not-disturb key (GOSET writes `notify_dnd=on`, the seat applies
# it live, the next boot reads it) and the crash-safe notification history (a
# corrupt NOTIFY.HIST is refused whole and heals to an empty one; the boot
# after finds nothing wrong). The notify -> DND -> held -> restart chain with
# a real sender is go-dogfood's boots 05/06.
#
# The panel takes focus when its declare is accepted and is typed into before
# the two-tab close choreography completes (the runner's --input-string
# watcher gives up after 40 s). GOCALC.ELF starts after both tabs close, so it
# gets the strip alone and cannot be captured by the M62e SESSION.TABS snapshot.
#
# Boot 02 proves the flip is a SETTING, not a hardcode: the same share boots
# the Zig TABWM seat -- the fallback the card requires to stay reachable.
# M63f (#1463): re-verified green after GOTABWM maxTicks 90 (M73z;
# was 48). No HID here.
#
# M66b (#1444): boots 03/04 add the corrupt-settings story. Boot 03 stages
# real corruption (the monitor's vf verbs overwrite SETTINGS.TXT with
# probe-pattern garbage); boot 04 boots on it -- the kernel refuses the
# file whole (one honest line, compiled defaults, the Go seat again), the
# seat's own decode reports `gotabwm: settings bad`, and the closing
# `settings set` heals the file through the crash-safe save (temp + fsync
# + delete/rename). The healed bytes are byte-compared on the host.
#
# M81g (#1767) adds boots 05-09: the SNAPSHOT bundle and the restore DRILL, in
# five steps staged by the seat and the monitor together — prep the table, take
# the snapshot with the seat's own Ctrl+Shift+S chord, restore it into the next
# boot, then refuse a corrupt bundle and a missing one. The card's deliverable
# is the drill, so the positive half is a boot like any other: the seat
# rehydrates the share and the boot then reads the restored files through its
# ORDINARY loadSettings/loadSession paths, which is why boot 07's byte-exact
# `share-equals` needs no new assert shape. The refusal halves are the M66b
# corrupt-settings story reused verbatim — one honest line, nothing written,
# the boot carries on. See the run-by-run table above the boots.
#
# HOST PREREQUISITE (fails the gate honestly when missing):
#   bash tools/go/build-gotabwm.sh   ->  .build/go/GOTABWM.ELF
#   bash tools/go/build-gosh.sh      ->  .build/go/GOSH.ELF (M76b first boot)
#   bash tools/go/build-gocalc.sh    ->  .build/go/GOCALC.ELF
#
# exec-order: assert-proven -- every stage gate is anchored on guest output the
# kernel, the seat or the hosted app produced (`gotabwm: win focus`,
# `gotabwm: win gone`, `gotabwm: tabs empty`, `goset: ready`, `tabwm:
# registered`). Runs 02-04 end on a marker only their own script prints. Run 01
# ends on the PANEL's publish line (`goset: saved `) and carries
# --script-expect-tail so the hold covers the seat's own clean exit -- the
# panel's save is the thing under test, and the tail keeps the `gotabwm OK` /
# `wm: unregistered, shim resumed` asserts honest rather than dropping them.
# Tail 90 -> 150 for M73z: the seat's budget went maxTicks 48 -> 90 (seat.go,
# boot 04's acceptance chain), so the exit now lands near the OLD 90 s tail's
# boundary -- observed 2026-09-23: serial cut at `gotabwm OK`, the kernel's
# unregister line just outside the capture.

# after the snapshot is taken, so boot 07 reporting `theme=light` AND
# byte-equalling THIS fixture can only have got those bytes from the bundle.
# `wm=gotabwm` is also what seats the Go desktop that performs the restore, so
# it has to be in the table.
#
# `theme` has to be a value the theme module HONORS: user/go/theme's Set
# accepts only dark and light, so `theme=amber` — a legal settings vocab value —
# leaves the seat painting dark and the token probe would report `theme=dark`
# whatever the file said (observed on the first M81g run). light is real, so
# the probe is a true witness of the decoded row.
#
# `prompt` carries NO trailing space here, unlike settings-healed.expected.
# That is not a typo: boot 04 heals a CORRUPT file, so the kernel serializes
# its compiled default table with `prompt=virelai> ` intact, whereas boot 05's
# `settings set` re-serializes a PARSED table — and the schema-v2 parse
# trims each value (virelai/settings Parse). So after any parse+set cycle the

# M81g (#1767): the snapshot bundle, and the restore DRILL
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The card's deliverable is the drill, not the archive step, so the runs below
# are staged by the seat and the monitor together and every step is checked
# against the share from the host:
#
#   05  prep        the settings table the snapshot will carry (wm=gotabwm so
#                   the Go desktop is seated, theme=light as the marker value)
#   06  take        the SEAT presses Ctrl+Shift+S; the follow-up script runs
#                   only after the `snapshot saved` marker, so the capture is
#                   provably taken BEFORE the settings are changed underneath
#                   it. That script then sets theme=dark (so a later restore is
#                   observable) and stages the one-shot SNAPSHOT.RESTORE.
#   07  restore     the seat rehydrates the share from the bundle: the token
#                   probe reports theme=light again and SETTINGS.TXT
#                   byte-equals settings-snapshot.expected.
#   08  corrupt     64 probe-pattern bytes are staged over the bundle and the
#                   request re-armed. The seat refuses the bundle WHOLE:
#                   one `snapshot bad` line, SETTINGS.TXT untouched, the
#                   request consumed, the boot otherwise normal.
#   09  absent      the bundle is removed and the request re-armed. A missing
#                   bundle is a different diagnosis from a corrupt one and is
#                   named as such; nothing is written either way.
#
# The two refusal runs are the M66b corrupt-settings shape reused verbatim:
# refuse whole, one honest line, compiled defaults, never a boot failure.

# Boot 05: the table the snapshot will carry. `wm=gotabwm` cannot be assumed —
# boot 04 healed the file to wm=tabwm — so the Go seat that performs the
# capture has to be asked for first, and the seat is chosen at boot.

# --- M82d2 (#1785): notifications policy, the persisted halves --------------
# Boots 13-16 prove what a restart must not lose or resurrect wrongly.
#
#   13  one typed GOSET edit, `notify_dnd=on`: a safe publish, and the LIVE
#       seat applies it without a restart (`via=settings`).
#   14  a fresh boot reads the persisted key (`via=boot`, printed only when it
#       is ON, so a default boot's log is unchanged) before the loop. The
#       script then stages a corrupt NOTIFY.HIST with the monitor's vf verbs,
#       the M66b boot-03 shape: 64 probe-pattern bytes, no valid header.
#   15  boots on the corrupt history. The seat refuses it WHOLE (`history
#       bad`, nothing restored) and heals it at once with a valid empty one
#       (`history healed`) -- BEFORE the first composite paint, so there is no
#       frame that ever showed a half-trusted history. The healed bytes are
#       byte-compared on the host.
#   16  the boot after the heal restores the empty history cleanly and says
#       nothing is wrong: a bad file costs the user their history once, and is
#       never re-reported.
#
# The seat's history file is /host/NOTIFY.HIST, written through the same
# crash-safe publish as SETTINGS.TXT (temp + fsync + delete/rename); a stale
# NOTIFY.HIST~ on the share after a publish would mean the rename never ran.

# The empty history the heal publishes, computed on the host from the codec's
# documented layout: magic "VNH" + version 1, a zero count, then the FNV-1a 32
# of those five bytes, little-endian (user/go/gotabwm/notify_policy.go).
