# go-net-clis.spec -- M71n (issue #1573) class-B gate: the Go net CLIs are
# reached BY TYPING THEM AT A GOSH PROMPT on a live network.
#
# The card's daily bar is "type a net verb in GOSH and get a Go program". Two
# things could be true while that bar is still unmet: the binaries exist but
# nothing names them (deliverable 1's `help` half, pinned by the host tests in
# user/go/sh -- TestHelpNamesTheNetCLIs), or GOSH cannot actually launch them
# over a real device. This spec is the second half, and it is the only place
# that runs: the exec goes through GOSH's OWN parser and RunExternal seam, so
# the marker below is GOSH's child's output, not the monitor's.
#
#   boot 01   GOSH (serial console) types `exec GOPING.ELF -c 3 10.0.0.2`
#             against the runner's ICMP responder  -> 3 round trips, exit 0
#   boot 02   GOSH types `exec GOFETCH.ELF https://10.0.0.2:24533/`
#             against the pinned TLS 1.3 fixture relayed to the guest
#             ->  `gofetch: handshake ok` / `gofetch: body complete`
#   boot 03   M83b (#1775): GOSH types `time sync 10.0.0.2`, `echo rc=$?` and
#             `date` against the runner's SNTP responder serving host time
#             +3600 s -> the guest clock is STEPPED an hour forward, exit 0,
#             and the next `date` reads the new clock
#   boot 04   M83b: the same three lines with NO responder -> one query on the
#             wire, `no reply ... clock untouched`, exit 1, and `date` still
#             reads the boot clock
#   boot 05   M83b: bare `time sync` (the default NAME) with no network at all
#             -> the live-net-offline sentence, `clock untouched`, exit 1, and
#             no DNS query attempted
#
# WHY THE CONSOLE SHELL AND NOT THE WINDOW: a windowed GOSH would need
# GOTABWM.ELF staged and a third live Go runtime (seat + shell + CLI), and
# go-sh.spec records that a THIRD SEQUENTIAL exec from one EL0 parent dies in
# the Go runtime's own schedinit. `GOSH.ELF serial` (ADR 0020 selector 1) is
# the same engine, the same parser and the same RunExternal, with only the
# monitor (Zig) as its parent -- so the two-Go-runtime envelope every
# go-* spec already proves holds here.
#
# WHY A NEW SPEC rather than a run in live-sh.spec: live-sh.spec owns the
# shell CORE (builtins, history, help) on a share with no network at all, and
# the two boots below need `--net` plus a device responder. The split keeps
# that spec's share pristine.
#
# WHAT PROVES THE EXEC CAME FROM GOSH, precisely, because the obvious reading
# is stronger than the wire supports: `exec: loaded <NAME>` is the MONITOR's
# line (kernel/src/monitor.zig cmd_exec) and an EL0 `sys_exec` does not print
# it. So the proof is a negative plus a positive:
#   * `exec: loaded GOPING.ELF` is ABSENT -- the monitor never ran it; and
#   * GOSH's own `gosh: line exec GOPING.ELF ...` submit record is present,
#     which only its line editor and parser produce; and
#   * the child's OWN output follows, ordered after that record.
# The monitor-side script contains neither the typed line nor the child's
# markers, so a boot in which GOSH never spawned the CLI cannot pass.
#
# HOST PREREQUISITE (fails the gate honestly when missing):
#   bash tools/go/build-gosh.sh      ->  .build/go/GOSH.ELF
#   bash tools/go/build-goping.sh    ->  .build/go/GOPING.ELF
#   bash tools/go/build-web.sh fetch GOFETCH -> .build/go/GOFETCH.ELF
