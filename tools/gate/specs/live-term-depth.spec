# live-term-depth.spec -- M49 card SD5 class-B gate (issue #1132),
# retargeted by M73d (#1628) onto GOTERM.ELF (the Zig TERM.BIN retires
# into M60's leftovers; markers move `term:` -> `goterm:` by prefix alone,
# the M66c/NOTE pattern — no assertion dropped).
#
# GOTERM first-class window terminal: a share script prints 20 numbered
# lines into the kernel presentation grid, the host pointer (custom-virtio
# kind-2, guest pixels) drag-selects a row in the window's client area, and
# the Ctrl+Shift+C chord copies the selection into the shared clipboard —
# all kernel-side for ANY tty-bound window (kernel/src/input.zig chord
# table, driving_award.zig selection), which is what makes this a front-end
# swap. The monitor `clip` command then prints the copied bytes on the
# serial console — observed selection/copy. M73e (#1629) adds the reverse:
# the wide drag selects all 20 rows (259 B > the old 256 B input queue),
# Ctrl+Shift+V pastes it back through the bound tty (bracketed, DECSET
# 2004), and the editor runs every pasted line — tail line included. Reflow/
# scrollback math is class-A (kernel/src/terminal.zig tests) with the
# paint-path width sync. Boot default is unchanged (the serial console
# still belongs to the monitor while GOTERM owns only its window).
# M73d geometry: this gate boots WITHOUT GOTABWM.ELF (shim compositing,
# GOTERM's kind-8 declare refused — the plain .user window still paints)
# at the classic terminal rect 64,48,640,400 — the SAME rect TERM.BIN
# declared. M73l (#1661, cell 8x16) re-anchors this gate: the 384 px
# client fits 24 rows at cell_h=16 (was 48 at 8), so a 30-line script
# would scroll LINE-00 out of the view and the drag could no longer
# reach it. BIG.SH is 20 lines — still every line, total 22 <= 24 so
# the view never scrolls and line1 stays visible. Both drag ends move:
# y76 = row1 at cell_h=8 but row0 (the prompt line) at 16, so the start
# becomes y84 (row1, client top y64) and the end y392 (row20) — line1
# col0 -> line20 col79 = exactly the 20 BIG.SH rows (259 B, still > the
# 256 B input queue the M73e assertion exists to prove) the copy
# asserts count, with the prompt line excluded and `clip: LINE-00`
# (not `clip: gosh> source ...`) back as the clipboard head.
#
# M80k (#1727) gets its OWN boot (run 03, below): the scrollback only
# exists once the 128-row grid has actually scrolled, and a 20-line paste
# never gets there. Runs 01/02 stay byte-identical to their M73d/#1688
# shape.
#
# M80i (#1725) gets its OWN boot (run 04, below): the zoom ladder leaves
# the 8x16 cell. `font` reports BOTH ladders (the boot look is text small
# + grid MEDIUM), `font large` moves both and re-flows the bound grid to
# the 10x21 cell, and the scanout carries the pixel proof — ink below
# y=112 in the client is impossible for three rows at 8x16 and is exactly
# where the 10x21 cell paints row 2.
#
# #1688: run 02 boots the SAME chain WITH the seat registered —
# GOTABWM.ELF is staged by a tag-01 assert (the go-dogfood WINDOWS.SAV
# precedent) so run 01's shim boot stays byte-identical — and the
# drag-select travels the new slot-65 cmd 15 content forward. Under a
# seat, kernel terminal selection is dormant by WMS5 (pointer_tick
# returns before every selection site); the forward is the only path
# that can print `dui: term sel begin/end` there, which is what makes
# the >256 B Ctrl+Shift+V paste reachable in a seated boot. This is the
# class-B proof for claim #1688, which unblocks M73z (#1638).
#
# HOST PREREQUISITE (fails the gate honestly when missing):
#   bash tools/go/build-gotabwm.sh   ->  .build/go/GOTABWM.ELF (the seat —
#     same reason as live-term: without it the boot falls back to shim
#     compositing and GOTERM's declare is refused)
#   bash tools/go/build-goterm.sh   ->  .build/go/GOTERM.ELF

# is the refused-declare 64,48 640x400 rect run 01 uses). FILL.SH scrolls the
# 128-row grid until the ring genuinely holds history, then the three chords
# are typed in order:
#   ctrl-shift-k      clear the scrollback (ED 3) + snap the view to the tail
#   ctrl-shift-r      soft reset — styles and modes, grid intact
#   ctrl-shift-alt-r  full RIS — the grid goes too
# Each is intercepted in kernel/src/input.zig BEFORE the tty queue, so the
# guest never sees a byte and the run ends on a monitor command issued after
# all three (script2 is forwarded on the RIS marker, which no script supplies
# — the exec-order anchor). Three snapshots read the SCANOUT at three points:
# filled, cleared (tail still painted), reset (client blank).
#
# exec-order: assert-proven — the run ends on `fill-chords-done`, which only
# script2 prints, and script2 is held behind the `tty: reset full` chord
# marker, so every chord has fired before the run can end.

# --- M80i (#1725): the zoom ladder leaves 8x16 --------------------------------
# Runs 04 and 05 are two more shim boots of the SAME chain (run 03's asserts
# left the share seat-free, so the window is the refused-declare 64,48 640x400
# rect). `echo pppp` paints THREE content rows (echo line, `pppp`, prompt);
# the pair of scanout frames — one per boot — is the pixel proof that the
# bound grid left 8x16:
#   run 04  the boot cell (8x16: rows at y 64/80/96). Glyph descent stays
#           inside the cell, so the client band y 112..127 is EMPTY: for
#           three rows of content there IS no row 4.
#   run 05  the large rung (10x21: rows at y 64/85/106) after the monitor
#           `font` gesture. Row 2 (the prompt) now paints through the same
#           band — glyph bodies and the `g` descender down to y 126, the
#           block cursor filling the cell — so the band MUST carry ink.
# Ink below y=112 is impossible at 8x16 for this content and unavoidable at
# 10x21: its appearance is the glyph-at-the-large-size pixel proof. Run 05's
# serial report names both ladders — the boot look (text small + grid medium)
# and the rung in force after (text large + grid large).
#
# TWO boots with ONE snapshot each, deliberately (the flake #1757 carries
# as a fixup; OBSERVED 2026-09-26): when more than one kind-4 request is in flight the channel
# coalesces it — the guest's `snap_pending` is a bool and the host's
# `pendingSnapPath` is a single slot the next stream header steals — so a
# multi-snapshot run can lose its first frame and misfile the rest (run 03
# and the first M80i draft both did). A lone request on an idle guest serves
# promptly (observed: the surviving streams in those runs), which is the
# live-web-ttf.spec single-trigger pattern this pair uses. The boots are the
# identical chain and content, so the frame pair states the same relation a
# one-boot before/after would.
