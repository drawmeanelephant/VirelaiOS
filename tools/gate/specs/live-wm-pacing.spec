# live-wm-pacing.spec -- M53 card 1 (#1247): what the desktop's frame cadence
# and input latency ACTUALLY are, measured rather than assumed.
#
# The question this gate exists to answer: in WM mode the kind-18
# COMPOSITE_TICK is 1 Hz (timer.zig `period_ns`), but `pointer_tick` returns
# early once a seat is registered and the present is the WM's own
# REQUEST_PRESENT — so 1 Hz is the HEARTBEAT, not necessarily the cadence.
# Nothing bounded either the rate or the latency before this card.
#
# The latency is measured in its two halves, because they have different
# owners: input sample -> REQUEST_PRESENT (the WM's loop turn) and
# REQUEST_PRESENT -> transfer+flush complete (the kernel + GPU cost). The
# `wm` monitor row reports both, plus the present and tick rates side by side.
#
# This gate proves the INSTRUMENT is live and sane on real hardware. The
# measured VALUES are the card's finding and are reported on the issue, not
# frozen here as a threshold nobody has justified.

# `--pointer-virtio` injects one HID report per step over the cv-input queue;
# each report becomes one kind-19 pointer sample fanned to the WM
# (`fan_pointer`), which is the LEFT edge of the latency sample. The WM
# answering with REQUEST_PRESENT is the right edge. Steps pace at 2.5 s, so
# 8 steps is a 20 s burst; script2 fires 30 s after `wnd: registered`, i.e.
# comfortably after the burst. The distinct positions matter: a repeated
# coordinate is a sample the WM may coalesce away, which would under-count
# the samples this gate is counting.
