# tools/lib/gate-run.sh (claim #1259) and for the false-PASS guard in
# tools/gate/vgate.sh (issue #1338).
#
# Why this exists: the preflight's whole job is to FAIL LOUDLY in two cases
# that used to surface at VM boot as something else. A checker whose negative
# path is never exercised is the same class of bug it was written to catch --
# it can be wired backwards, or stop matching, and still report green. So the
# negative paths are asserted here, on a CI runner, with no VM anywhere.
#
# Same reasoning, one level up, for the harness itself (issue #1338): a run
# that ends before its result block must never read as PASS, and the shells
# where that is possible (bash < 4.4 exits ZERO on an empty-array expansion
# under `set -u`) must be refused at the door. Both are asserted below.
#
# Hermetic by construction: `codesign` and `sysctl` are stubbed on PATH, so the
# real signature of any binary and the real capability of any host are
# irrelevant to the result. Class A -- runs in CI, needs no Apple silicon.
