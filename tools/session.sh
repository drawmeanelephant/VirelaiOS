# session.sh -- boot an INTERACTIVE, WINDOWED VirelaiOS desktop.
#
# This is the human front door the gate fleet never needed: the class-B/C
# gates boot a VM, drive it with scripts, assert serial evidence, and exit.
# A person who just wants to *use* the machine had to reconstruct the gate
# harness by hand. This script packages the missing pieces:
#
#   1. build the guest + image + the SPIKE runner (the host file channel
#      `--cvc-file` implies the custom-virtio device shape, which only the
#      SPIKE build declares);
#   2. seed a PERSISTENT host share (apps, APPS.TXT, wallpaper, fonts, and
#      the Go seat) -- M34/HF6 removed the apps from the disk image, so
#      without this the shell has nothing to `exec`;
#   3. boot with the GPU window + USB keyboard/pointing devices attached
#      (`--display --input`);
#   4. let the compiled boot default apply: M59 (issue #1298) flipped `wm`
#      to the GO seat, so a boot lands in GOTABWM.ELF. The `.virelairc` in
#      the share says so and offers the two escapes -- `settings set wm
#      tabwm` for the Zig desktop, VIRELAI_SESSION_NO_TABWM=1
#      for the classic floating-window WM. When the Go seat or its starter
#      shell cannot be built, the rc falls back to `tabwm start` and says so.
#
# The canonical `artifacts/disk.img` is attached READ-ONLY through a
# throwaway ASIF overlay, so a session never mutates the shared gate image.
# User files, settings, history, and the wallpaper live in the share and
# persist between sessions.
#
# Apple silicon + macOS 27+ only (Virtualization.framework + DiskImageKit).
# This is NOT a gate and is not run in CI.
#
# Usage:
#   bash tools/session.sh            # windowed desktop
#   just session
#
# Environment:
#   VIRELAI_SESSION_SHARE=<dir>      share directory (default artifacts/session-share)
#   VIRELAI_SESSION_NO_TABWM=1       no seat autostart: the floating-window WM
#   VIRELAI_SESSION_NO_GOTABWM=1     do not build/stage the Go seat and shell
#                                    (the rc then falls back to `tabwm start`)
#   VIRELAI_SESSION_SKIP_BUILD=1     skip the build step (reuse the last build)
#
# Controls: close the VM window, choose Quit VirelaiOS (Cmd-Q), or press
# Ctrl-C in this terminal to stop the VM. Rerun the command to relaunch.
# Guest serial output is written to
# artifacts/session-serial.log.
