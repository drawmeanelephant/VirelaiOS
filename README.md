# VirelaiOS

[![CI](https://github.com/drawmeanelephant/DipshitOS/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/drawmeanelephant/DipshitOS/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A from-scratch AArch64 operating system. It boots under real UEFI firmware on
**Apple silicon**, hosted by Apple's **Virtualization.framework**
(**macOS 27 or newer**). It is **not Linux, not Unix, and not QEMU** — no
libc, no POSIX, no existing guest OS, no emulator in the boot path. The guest
is freestanding [Zig](https://ziglang.org/); the host launcher is Swift.

The name is a joke. The engineering is not: every subsystem is either verified
deterministically or **live-gated** on real hardware.

## Status

Every milestone through **M86** has landed, and every milestone index but one
has closed (observed 2026-09-29). The **boot default is the Go seat**:
`GOTABWM.ELF` autostarts and hosts Go EL0
clients over the `WM_RPC` tab contract, with Zig `TABWM.BIN` retained by
decision (ADR 0034) as the `settings set wm tabwm` fallback. The one open arc is
**M84, remote framebuffer** ([#1807](https://github.com/drawmeanelephant/DipshitOS/issues/1807)) —
an RFB server a Mac can Screen Share into. The guest wire and its live gate
landed; the macOS Screen Sharing tape is blocked on
[#1835](https://github.com/drawmeanelephant/DipshitOS/issues/1835), because
Screen Sharing refuses the `None` security type. The arcs around it — terminal
graphics (`IMGCAT.ELF` over sixel) and window chrome with the published
`appkit` canvas — are closed. [`docs/status.md`](docs/status.md) is the canonical
accounting and the readable summary is the
[documentation site](https://drawmeanelephant.github.io/DipshitOS/).

The first thirty-one milestones — the boot
pipeline, the interactive `virelai>` monitor, userspace (allocator,
scheduler, EL0 + syscalls), processes (IPC, wait, kill), networking
(virtio-net → ARP → IPv4/ICMP → UDP → DHCP → TCP), graphics (framebuffer →
Road Pops terminal → Driving Award window manager), input (USB XHCI + HID),
usability, app events, the userland filesystem, the desktop platform —
`CALC.BIN`, `NOTEPAD.BIN`, `TOP.BIN` are all retired Zig (M62h/M66c/M71g),
now the Go `GOCALC.ELF` / `NOTE.ELF` / `GOTOP.ELF` — alongside `GOFILES.ELF`
and the `GOTABWM.ELF` seat, network
apps, shared services (clipboard + app timers), audio, kernel consolidation,
desktop completeness and the post-M17 arcs, and the M18–M27 experience layer
(terminal & shell depth, shell programming, text rendering & Unicode, window
management depth, developer tools, the text editor, CALC, file manager depth,
network experience, desktop polish).

The 2026-08-27 hardware-depth trio rounded it out:

- **M28 — SMP:** a second CPU core online via PSCI, per-core schedulers,
  spinlocks, and GICv3 IPIs — `smp: cores=2 online=2` live-gated on real VZ.
- **M29 — VM depth:** demand paging, copy-on-write, and anonymous
  `sys_mmap`/`sys_munmap` (ADR 0007 slots 63/64).
- **M30 — dynamic linking:** a freestanding runtime linker (`LD.SO`) plus
  `LIBUI.SO`/`LIBFONT.SO` shared libraries, zero libc, W^X multi-aperture
  isolation, live-gated.
- **M31 — dynamic linking ecosystem:** the desktop apps migrated to dynamic
  executables (`CALC.ELF`, `NOTEPAD.ELF`, `FILE.ELF`, `DESKTOP.ELF`) with
  runtime `dlopen`/`dlsym` plugin loading.

Also landed: an in-guest HTTP/1.1 web server (claim 0750 — Zig `HTTPD.BIN` was
retired to `GOHTTPD.ELF` in M71l), offline preflight for the M26 network apps
(N13/N14), and a
wall-clock bounding fix for `sys_tcp_connect` (#613).

**Right now:** the boot default is the Go seat, and the Go toolchain runs
in-guest — a single boot autostarts `GOTABWM.ELF` and hosts Go clients as tabs
(the shell `GOSH.ELF`, the editor `NOTE.ELF`), and the guest's own
`cmd/compile` + `cmd/link` build and run the pinned hello program
(`live-selfhost-go`). Everything since M31 is one row per milestone in
[`docs/status.md`](docs/status.md); this README does not duplicate that table.

## Quick start

To open a usable windowed desktop from a clean clone, run this from the
repository root on Apple silicon with macOS 27 or newer:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/drawmeanelephant/DipshitOS.git
cd DipshitOS
source tools/env-check.sh
just session
```

`just session` builds the guest, disk image, and windowed VM runner, seeds the
persistent share at `artifacts/session-share`, and opens the desktop. The VM
window takes keyboard and mouse input; press Ctrl-C in the launching terminal
to end the session. Guest serial output is saved to
`artifacts/session-serial.log`. This is an interactive class-C session, so it
does not run in CI.

The environment check verifies the modern Homebrew host tools. If it fails
because macOS system tools appear first in `PATH`, run
`brew install bash gnu-sed jq yq`, fix `PATH` as the check instructs, and
source `tools/env-check.sh` again. The session also requires `just`, Zig,
Swift/Xcode command-line tools, and Python 3.

Session options (set before `just session`):

```bash
VIRELAI_SESSION_SHARE=/path/to/share just session
VIRELAI_SESSION_NO_TABWM=1 just session
VIRELAI_SESSION_NO_GOTABWM=1 just session
VIRELAI_SESSION_SKIP_BUILD=1 bash tools/session.sh
```

`VIRELAI_SESSION_SHARE` relocates the persistent share. On a share without an
existing `.virelairc`, `VIRELAI_SESSION_NO_TABWM=1` starts the classic floating
window manager; `VIRELAI_SESSION_NO_GOTABWM=1` skips the Go seat and writes a
startup file for the Zig TABWM fallback. Existing `.virelairc` files are kept
as-is. `VIRELAI_SESSION_SKIP_BUILD=1` skips the script's own build steps when
calling `tools/session.sh` directly; the runner, `artifacts/disk.img`, and
staged files must already exist. `just session` retains its normal Zig image
dependency.

### Remote-only terminal through host SSH

On the Apple-silicon VM host, start a foreground service with a **dedicated**
absolute share (not your desktop share):

```bash
bash tools/remote-terminal.sh serve --share /absolute/remote-share
```

In another host terminal, or from a different machine through OpenSSH:

```bash
bash tools/remote-terminal.sh attach --share /absolute/remote-share
ssh -tt operator@vm-host 'cd /absolute/VirelaiOS && bash tools/remote-terminal.sh attach --share /absolute/remote-share'
```

The operator must already have authorized SSH key access and Remote Login
enabled on the host. Use the same host account for serve and attach.
Verify the host-key fingerprint through a trusted
channel before accepting it; never disable host-key checking. These tools do
not enable SSH, install servers, use sudo, or change firewall/router settings.
SSH supplies remote encryption. The loopback HMAC bridge authenticates but
does **not** encrypt; host-account authorization grants guest-console authority.

`serve` builds/checks the image, SPIKE runner and source-fresh GOSH. It seeds
`#v2`, `wm=none`, `shell=sh`, GOSH and serial support files, without a GUI
seat or a boot-default change. Documents and `GOSH-HISTORY.TXT` persist.
Executable/support files refresh on service restart. Incompatible settings,
an active `.virelairc`, or a nonempty unconfigured share are refused, never
rewritten. `--port 24681` is the default, validated and always loopback-only.
Private session state and the file-only random secret live outside the share
under `~/.virelai/remote-terminal/`; reattachments reuse the live secret.
The build needs the provisioned `GOOS=virelai` fork (`bash tools/go/apply.sh`
then `just go-toolchain`); set `GO_FORK_DIR` when it is outside the checkout's
parent directory.

Ctrl-C in **attach** cancels the guest line; Ctrl-] disconnects only the
client. Reattach reaches the same live VM, and a disconnected partial line
is cancelled. Ctrl-C in **serve** stops the VM and cleans only its temporary
state/vars/overlay, not the share. Ctrl-D on an empty GOSH line, `exit`, or
`monitor` hands serial back to the kernel monitor; that is not a GOSH
acceptance. From the still-connected monitor, `exec GOSH.ELF serial` returns
to GOSH, or restart the service. A second client gets a busy refusal.

This is a host terminal rendering serial bytes, not guest SSH, Screen,
PTY-size negotiation, graphics, resize, or expanded TUI compatibility.
The required **real two-machine** fixture and its precise blockers are in
[`docs/testing.md`](docs/testing.md#remote-terminal-m87).

For serial-only development or deterministic builds, use the lower-level
commands:

```bash
zig build            # compile the AArch64 UEFI application
zig build image      # build the GPT+FAT32 disk image
zig build run        # serial takeover path
```

`zig build run` writes kernel serial output to `artifacts/vm-serial.log`.
`zig build console` opens an interactive `virelai>` console, and
`zig build test-console` runs the deterministic transcript test.

**Requirements:** Apple silicon, macOS 27+, Zig 0.16.0, `just`, Swift + Xcode
command-line tools, Python 3, bash, and the Homebrew `bash`, `gnu-sed`, `jq`,
and `yq` tools. No root, no `mtools`, no Linux/QEMU path.

## Verification

The project separates two classes of evidence:

- **Class A** — deterministic (formatting, unit tests, a byte-identical console
  transcript, the build pipeline). Runs in CI on every push.
- **Class B** — **live-gated**: boots a real Virtualization.framework VM on
  Apple silicon and asserts on what the kernel reports. CI cannot run these.

```bash
just verify-portable   # class A, mirrors CI
just verify-vz         # class B, Apple silicon, boots real VMs
```

## Layout

- `boot/` — the AArch64 UEFI boot loader.
- `kernel/` — the freestanding kernel and every subsystem.
- `user/` — EL0 programs: flat `.BIN` images, dynamic `.ELF` executables,
  and the `LD.SO`/`LIBUI.SO`/`LIBFONT.SO` shared libraries.
- `host/vm-runner/` — the Swift Virtualization.framework launcher.
- `site/` — the public documentation corpus (compiled by Boris).
- `docs/` — the engineering warehouse: claims, decisions (ADRs), status,
  hardware contract, gate inventory, and the [memorial to `calm-lavoisier`](docs/calm-lavoisier-memorial.md).
- [`docs/app-authoring.md`](docs/app-authoring.md) — the short path from an
  empty Go app to a staged, gated EL0 client.
