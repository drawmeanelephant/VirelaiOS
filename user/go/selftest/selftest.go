// Command selftest is GOSELF.ELF (M61b/M61c, issues #1382/#1383): the first
// guest-owned pass/fail evidence in the fleet.
//
// The contract is ADR 0031 (docs/decisions/0031-guest-selftest.md):
//
//	/host/SELFTEST/REPORT.txt  `case <id> pass|fail <detail>` lines in list
//	                           order, then `summary cases=<n> failed=<k>`
//	/host/SELFTEST/OUT/        one small receipt per case (the proof the host
//	                           reads back on macOS)
//	serial                     `selftest: case <id> pass|fail`, then
//	                           `selftest: FAIL n=<k>` and `selftest OK` (k==0)
//
// Serial is the heartbeat; the files are the proof. The report is written and
// closed BEFORE any summary line is printed, so the host can never read a
// summary while the report is missing or stale, and every marker is printed
// only AFTER its syscall returned (the GOEDIT/GOCALC discipline). The report
// bytes are deterministic — no timestamps, no pointers — which is what makes a
// `share-equals` fixture legal in M61f.
//
// The cases drive a `syscalls` struct rather than calling `vi` directly, so
// the case logic is host-testable: `go test ./selftest` injects fakes and the
// guest build uses guestSyscalls.
