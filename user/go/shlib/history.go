// belongs to the core.

// The monitor's HISTORY.TXT (M18 T4) belongs to the kernel actor; GOSH's
// recall was session-only, so a reboot cost the Up arrow. This is the
// shell's own file on the same share: a different name, the same
// one-line-per-entry LF shape, so a human can cat it and neither writer can
// clobber the other.
