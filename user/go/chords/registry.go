// Package chords is M82c (#1770): the global shortcuts registry.
//
// Before this package every global chord was owned by whoever remembered to
// document it: the kernel's chrome chords lived as comments in
// kernel/src/input.zig, the seat's chords as scattered `if`s in
// gotabwm/hid.go, and each app's chords as its own key handler. Two features
// could claim the same chord silently. This package is the ONE table that
// names every global chord, its owner, and the dispatch point it is served
// at — plus the checker that refuses two owners of one chord with a named
// error.
//
// Ownership is per DISPATCH POINT (Scope), because the machine really has
// several: the kernel consumes its chrome chords while a kernel terminal
// front-end is focused, the seat acts on kind-21 WM_KEY always, and an app
// acts on its own KEY_DOWN while focused. One owner per (chord, scope) is
// the invariant; the checker refuses a second. Where a chord is genuinely
// served at two dispatch points today — ctrl+shift+f and ctrl+shift+v are
// both kernel terminal-window chrome AND seat chords — the table records
// both rows, so the coexistence is documented instead of silent; any THIRD
// claimant at either dispatch point is refused.
//
// The kernel's rows are FROZEN: the kernel is untouched by this card and no
// seat or app may take a kernel chrome chord at the kernel's dispatch point.
//
// Consumers:
//
//   - gotabwm/hid.go dispatches its seat chords FROM the table (a chord not
//     in the table is not the seat's, and still reaches the app per ADR 0009).
//   - goset renders the table (ctrl+shift+s toggles its shortcuts view).
//   - The host tests in this package pin the shipped table and prove the
//     checker refuses the deliberately conflicting fixture.
