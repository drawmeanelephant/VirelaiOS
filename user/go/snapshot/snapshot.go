// Package snapshot is the M81g (#1767) snapshot bundle codec: the container
// that carries the state a person would hate to lose — the settings table,
// the session strip and a selection of documents — across a restore into a
// fresh boot.
//
// The card's deliverable is the RESTORE DRILL, not the archive step, so the
// codec is built to fail closed and whole. A bundle is either every entry it
// claims or it is nothing: `Parse` validates the WHOLE container before a
// caller writes a single byte, and any doubt is a refusal. That is the same
// rule the schema-v2 settings header already follows (virelai/settings refuses
// a newer schema whole rather than half-reading it), and it is why this is a
// package rather than a helper in one app: the seat (GOTABWM.ELF) writes and
// restores bundles, and the self-test (GOSELF.ELF) proves the round-trip, and
// "one codec, two consumers" is the M71f arrangement that stopped the seat's
// decode and the panel's from drifting.
//
// # Format
//
//	#vb1 <entries>\n
//	<name> <nbytes>\n
//	<nbytes of raw body>
//	<name> <nbytes>\n
//	<nbytes of raw body>
//	...
//
// One header line carrying the version AND the entry count, then entries.
// Each entry is a one-line header naming the entry and its EXACT body length
// in bytes, followed by exactly that many raw bytes.
//
// The framing is unambiguous BY CONSTRUCTION: a parser consumes exactly nbytes
// of body and never re-interprets a body byte as a header. A body may
// therefore hold any bytes at all — SESSION.TABS is the binary `.tabs` v2
// strip, and a line-oriented text format could not carry it.
//
// The ENTRY COUNT in the header is what makes truncation detectable at an
// entry BOUNDARY, and without it the "whole or nothing" promise is only half
// true: a bundle cut cleanly after its first entry is a perfectly well-formed
// one-entry bundle, indistinguishable from a producer that meant to write one
// entry. A restore would then succeed on half the state and report success.
// With the count, a short bundle is a refusal at any cut point — which is the
// property go-selftest's `TestNoTruncatedPrefixOfABundleParses` pins.
//
// There is no compression, no dedup and no directory structure: a bundle is a
// flat list of named blobs, and "which file does this name mean on the share"
// is the CALLER's mapping, not the codec's.
//
// # Refusals
//
// Every refusal is whole, and each carries a reason so a marker line can name
// the one thing that was wrong. The reasons are deliberately distinct: "this
// file is not a bundle" (header) and "this bundle claims more than we
// understand" (entry-name) are different diagnoses, and a gate that asserts a
// refusal wants to pin which one fired.
