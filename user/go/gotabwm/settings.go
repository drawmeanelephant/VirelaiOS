// GOTABWM.ELF — M66b (#1444): the schema-v2 SETTINGS.TXT decode, the
// corrupt-fails-closed twin of M62e's `.tabs` v2 session handling.
//
// M71f (#1565) moved the codec itself to virelai/settings, because the Go
// settings panel (GOSET.ELF) reads and writes the same file: one codec, two
// consumers, one verdict. The seat keeps only what is seat business — the
// markers its own gates grep, the `wm` report, and the token probe — so the
// decode the seat rejects and the decode the panel rejects cannot drift.
//
// A bad file is reported and IGNORED: the seat boots on its own defaults,
// nothing is written back, and a corrupt file is never laundered into a
// half-parsed one. (The panel reads the same verdict and refuses to write.)
