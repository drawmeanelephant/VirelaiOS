// GOTABWM.ELF — M81g (#1767): the snapshot bundle, and the restore drill.
//
// The card's deliverable is the DRILL, not the archive step: state a person
// would hate to lose (the settings table, the session strip, a selection of
// documents) goes into one crash-safe bundle under a standard path, and a
// fresh boot rehydrates from it byte-exact. The container itself is
// virelai/snapshot — one codec, two consumers, the M71f arrangement — so the
// bytes the self-test proves are the bytes this seat restores.
//
// # Restore is a FILE rehydration, not a state injection
//
// The restore writes the bundle's entries back to the share through the SAME
// crash-safe publish everything else uses (vi.WriteFileSafe: temp + fsync +
// delete/rename), and then the seat's ordinary boot continues: loadSettings
// and loadSession read the files they always read. That is deliberate, and it
// is why this card needs no change to either of them:
//
//   - a restored settings table is decoded by the M66b path, so a restored
//     file that is somehow still bad produces the SAME "settings bad" line
//     and the SAME compiled defaults a hand-corrupted file does;
//   - a restored SESSION.TABS is applied by the M62e path, so the restored
//     strip carries the same placeholder-id and freeze semantics.
//
// Restore therefore adds a way for the three files to BE there before the
// boot reads them, and no new way for them to be wrong.
//
// # All-or-nothing
//
// snapshot.Parse validates the WHOLE container before this file writes a
// single byte, so a bundle whose last entry is corrupt has not already
// republished its first. A corrupt or absent bundle is refused WHOLE: no
// entry is written, the live files are left exactly as they were, and the
// seat's existing corrupt-fails-closed handling takes over — compiled
// defaults, an empty strip, never a boot failure. That is the M66b
// corrupt-settings behavior, reused verbatim rather than reimplemented.
//
// The one thing that is not all-or-nothing is an I/O error partway through a
// VALID bundle: the entries validated, and a failed publish leaves that one
// file either its old bytes or absent (never garbage — that is what the safe
// publish buys). A failed step is named on its own marker, so a partial
// restore is reported as partial and never claimed as byte-exact.
//
// # The drill is opt-in, in both directions
//
// Neither half runs on its own: a bundle is not taken because time passed
// (no scheduled snapshots), and it is not applied because it happens to exist
// (which would silently rewind every later boot to the snapshot).
//
//   - SAVE is a chord the person presses: Ctrl+Shift+S (see hid.go). It is
//     the on-demand shape the card asks for.
//   - RESTORE is a one-shot REQUEST staged on the share: a
//     /host/SNAPSHOT.RESTORE file. The seat consumes it either way, so a
//     corrupt bundle cannot poison every later boot and a good one restores
//     exactly once. This is the same explicit-trigger idiom as the seat's
//     existing GOTABWM.DEMO mode file (M79a), and it is what lets a gate
//     stage "restore this into a fresh boot" without a kernel verb.
