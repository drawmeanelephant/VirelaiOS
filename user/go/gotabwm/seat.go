// GOTABWM.ELF — M57a (issue #1313): a Go window manager registers the kernel

//
//	vi.WmctlRegister (65/1)         -> gotabwm: registered
//	vi.WmctlRegister again (EACCES) -> gotabwm: seat-taken
//	vi.MmapScanout (63, scan tag)   -> gotabwm: scanout
//	paint the blank desktop         -> gotabwm: draw
//	seat held, awaiting ticks       -> gotabwm: holding seat
//	COMPOSITE_TICK (kind 18)        -> gotabwm: tick
//	paint the clock/status chrome   -> gotabwm: clock-source / gotabwm: clock
//	paint the notify strip (M79k)   -> gotabwm: notify paint id=<n> (once)
//	                                then gotabwm: notify dismiss id=<n> (expiry or click)
//	WM_POINTER (kind 19)            -> gotabwm: ptr
//	WM_KEY (kind 21)                -> gotabwm: key
//	vi.WmctlRequestPresent (65/3)   -> gotabwm: present

//	clean exit                      -> gotabwm OK
//
// M79a (#1704): the loop is LIVE by default -- it runs until the process is
// killed, never auto-closes a hosted tab, and never runs the strip
// choreography. The bounded M57-era demo (the maxTicks ceiling, the hostTicks
// auto-close, and the reorder/pin/split/close chain) is DEMO mode, entered
// only when the harness seeds /host/GOTABWM.DEMO. The mode is decided once at
// startup and named in one marker, before the window phase:
//
//	seeded /host/GOTABWM.DEMO       -> gotabwm: mode demo
//	absent (the product default)    -> gotabwm: mode live
//	live tick past the demo ceiling -> gotabwm: live steady tabs=<n>
//
// Each marker is printed ONLY after its syscall/step succeeded, so the marker
// chain IS the syscall chain. The kernel's exit path unregisters the seat and
// prints `wm: unregistered, shim resumed`; the class-B gate
// (tools/gate/specs/go-wm-seat.spec) asserts every line above, plus the `wm`
// monitor report naming the live seat.
