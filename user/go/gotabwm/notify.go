// GOTABWM.ELF — M79k (issue #1720): the notify seam. An app that finishes a
// long operation or fails a save had nowhere to say so except serial output
// nobody is reading; kind 12 gives it a bounded toast strip on the scanout.
//
// Shape, and why each bound exists:
//
//   - WM_RPC kind 12 carries the message in the frame's 24-byte title — the
//     whole text budget (vi.Notify). No payload channel, no base64.
//   - The queue is NotifyMax deep and the OLDEST entry is dropped, never a
//     refusal: a flood of notifications must degrade to "the newest few",
//     not to a seat that stops answering. The drop is counted, so the
//     honesty marker can say it happened.
//   - Lifetime is in composite ticks, not wall time: compositeTick already
//     receives the tick count, and the seat's tick is the scheduler's 1 Hz
//     heartbeat. A toast is (born, expires) in ticks.
//   - The fade is a three-step colour ramp over the last notifyFadeTicks
//     ticks, NOT a hard cut and NOT alpha: fillRect writes an opaque
//     pixel (tabs.go), so blending would need machinery the seat does not
//     have. Three named Surface→Bg steps are a pixel-testable middle ground.
//   - Paint order: the toast strip is painted AFTER the launcher and after
//     chromeTick, so a notification fired by the app the user just launched
//     is never hidden by the launcher they are typing into. The pointer
//     path is ordered to match — the toast is hit-tested BEFORE the
//     launcher's own handling, so what is on top is what the click finds.
//     Pinned by TestToastSurvivesTheRestOfTheTick and
//     TestToastHitPrecedesTheLauncher.
//   - Geometry: the stack lives in the bottom-LEFT corner, so it clears the
//     22px top rail, the 148x20 bottom-right clock panel, and the centred
//     start surface. A new toast appears nearest the bottom edge and
//     pushes the older ones UP; the oldest is the top of the band, the
//     newest the panel against the bottom inset.
//   - Click-to-focus uses focusHosted, the same helper alt-tab and rail
//     clicks use, so a toast is one more way to the same focus transition
//     (WIN_FOCUS to the sender) — not a private path.
//
// The transient toast strip and the seat-owned history center share each
// accepted notice. Toasts expire; center entries remain until dismissed or
// cleared. M82d2 (#1785) adds the policy half in notify_policy.go: while
// do-not-disturb is on a notice goes to the center only, and the center's
// history survives a seat restart. Sounds and per-app permission gating are
// out of scope.
