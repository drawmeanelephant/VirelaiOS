// Command note is the Go successor to the Zig notepad: M66c (issue #1445), and
// as of #1485 the ONLY text-app client — the Zig binary and user/src/notepad.zig
// are deleted. A small notepad — open, edit, save — full-viewport inside the
// tabbed desktop through user/go/tabapp, over the M66a-hardened file surface.
// The card's shape is M62h (#1406, CALC.BIN -> GOCALC.ELF) applied to the other
// leftover binary.
//
// It is deliberately NOT an editor: no find/replace, no selection, no undo.
// GOEDIT.ELF owns that arms race. What this app must have is the three things
// the seat gates assert of a hosted tab — it declares itself tab-aware, it
// relayouts on WIN_RESIZE, and it closes cleanly on WIN_CLOSE — plus load/save.
// The marker names mirror the Zig app's whole lifecycle vocabulary (`note:
// ready`, `note: tab-aware (full-viewport)`, `note: settled`, `note: exiting`,
// `note: win_close`, `note: resize relayout`), because the seat specs that
// assert them today move to this app by prefix alone. See the marker block
// below for the two places the vocabularies deliberately differ.
//
// Two deliberate behaviour choices, both recorded here because a retarget has
// to reconcile them with the Zig app's coverage:
//
//   - The file is loaded at STARTUP and saved with Ctrl-S (and automatically on
//     WIN_CLOSE when the buffer is dirty, so closing a tab does not silently
//     drop what was typed). The Zig notepad drove load/save from buttons;
//     buttons are not part of this card, and auto-save-on-close is the version
//     that cannot lose an edit by forgetting to save.
//     What that does NOT buy, because the wording matters: vi.WriteFileSafe
//     publishes delete-then-rename, so a crash inside that window leaves
//     notes.txt ABSENT rather than half-written, and the next boot opens an
//     empty notepad. "Never half-written" is the guarantee here; "cannot lose
//     data" would be an overstatement.
//   - Long lines are CLIPPED at the right edge rather than wrapped (see
//     Buffer.View). Wrapping would make one logical line two rows, and the
//     caret's row a function of the canvas width.
//
// The event wire carries a Unicode codepoint in arg1 (ADR 0014). The 8x8 face
// falls back to '?' for unsupported glyphs, but the buffer and saved file keep
// the codepoint's complete UTF-8 encoding.
//
// Every marker below is printed only AFTER its syscall returned, so a gate
// asserting them can only pass if the app actually ran.
