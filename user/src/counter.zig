//! VirelaiOS second ESP user program — COUNTER.BIN (milestone-four
//! follow-on 2, claim 4613; extended by follow-on 3 card 3f, claim 5965 —
//! the IPC sender; extended by follow-on 4 card 4b, claim 3179 — the
//! burst cadence; extended by follow-on 4 card 4c, claim 9946 — the
//! exit-status observer).
//!
//! The strong liveness proof the claim-0826 concurrent gate lacks: claim
//! 0826 ran TWO live processes, but both were copies of the SAME program
//! (USER.BIN) and BOTH exited after a few ticks. This program is the
//! permanent occupant: a DISTINCT second image (built from this file by
//! the same build/elf2bin pipeline as USER.BIN, embedded on the ESP as
//! COUNTER.BIN) that NEVER exits — it loops forever writing its own
//! distinct marker through sys_write (fd 1, slot 1) each quantum, spins
//! briefly, and yields (sys_yield, slot 2) — only the frozen ADR-0007
//! slots 1 + 2, no sys_exit. While it runs, the shell, the worker, AND
//! other concurrently-exec'd programs all stay responsive: the process
//! occupies its pool slot and address space permanently, and the live
//! gate reaps + re-execs the short USER.BIN into a freed slot while the
//! counter's markers keep landing.
//!
//! Card 3f (claim 5965) + card 4b (claim 3179): COUNTER.BIN is also the
//! IPC SENDER. When exec'd with a target process id argument
//! (`exec COUNTER.BIN <pid>`, claim-4636 argv), it parses argv[0] as the
//! peer's pid and — every 6th iteration — sends a BURST of 6 messages
//! back-to-back in ONE quantum: each message is formatted as "ping <d>\n"
//! into a 64-byte stack scratch buffer, printed as "ipc: ping <d>"
//! (sys_write, slot 1 — the live gate's send marker), and sent through
//! sys_ipc_send (slot 5, the card-3f ABI amendment) to the peer's
//! per-process mailbox. A negative send result (ENOSPC -5 or an error)
//! prints the distinct "ipc: enospc\n" marker — the live gate asserts
//! ZERO of them. The 5 quiet iterations between bursts let the peer drain
//! one message per round (the peer is not scheduled mid-burst — one
//! quantum is one task — so the 8-slot ring peaks at 6 of 8 and drains to
//! 0 before the next burst: NEVER refused, deterministically). The peer
//! echoes each message back ("peer: got ping <d>", byte-exact). Exec'd
//! WITHOUT an argument (argc == 0 — how the earlier long-lived gates run
//! it), the counter's behavior is byte-identical to claim 4613: marker +
//! spin + yield, no IPC.
//!
//! Card 4c (claim 9946): COUNTER.BIN is also the EXIT-STATUS OBSERVER.
//! When exec'd with a SECOND argument (`exec COUNTER.BIN 0 <waitpid>` —
//! argv[0] stays the optional IPC target, argv[1] the wait target), the
//! counter's FIRST iteration prints the "ipc: waiting pid=<n>" marker and
//! blocks in sys_wait (slot 8) until the target process exits; the wake
//! patches the observed status into the counter's saved frame, and the
//! counter prints "ipc: saw pid=<n> status=<s>" — the EL0-side proof that
//! the kernel propagated the target's exit status to a peer — then falls
//! into the permanent-occupant marker loop (the wait runs exactly ONCE).
//! argv[0] = 0 (a pid the guard treats as no target) keeps the IPC path
//! silent in the wait gate.
//!
//! The payload is the same shape as USER.BIN's (naked asm, fixed register
//! ABI only — no Zig-generated memory references or calls): registers
//! x19-x28 carry the entry contract and loop state across SVC boundaries
//! (the kernel saves/restores the full frame), the scratch buffer lives on
//! the program's OWN writable EL0 stack, and the terminal branch is
//! unreachable by construction (the loop never exits).
//!
//! The marker bytes are also exposed as `pub const`s so the host tests
//! pin the EXACT marker shapes (the serial log's grep targets for this
//! program) and the sys_write/sys_ipc_send lengths used in the payload
//! cannot drift from them.
