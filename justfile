# Verification classes (definitions: docs/gate-inventory.md; the generated
# fleet inventory: docs/gate-fleet-inventory.md — M40 GF5):
#   A — portable / build CI. Deterministic, no Apple silicon, no VZ VM.
#       This is exactly what GitHub CI proves. `just verify-portable` runs
#       the same set locally (`just verify` is a legacy alias).
#   B — Apple-silicon Virtualization.framework hardware gate. Boots a real
#       VZ VM on Apple silicon. CI does NOT run these and cannot prove them;
#       run `just verify-vz` on a development host.
#   C — interactive / manual hardware gate. Needs a human at the keyboard.
#   D — diagnostic experiment. NOT an acceptance gate.

# Legacy alias for the full portable/build gate set (class A)
alias verify := verify-portable

# Run the full portable/build gate set (class A; mirrors CI). Does NOT run
# the Apple-silicon VZ hardware gates (class B) — that is `just verify-vz`.
