//! VirelaiOS M32 WMS2 render-server register (issue #622) — the kernel half
//! of the ADR 0015 seam-A render-server boundary, implemented BESIDE the
//! unchanged shim (`kernel/src/driving_award.zig`).
//!
//! This module owns the render-server seam's minimal observable state:
//! the single WM registrant (one seat), the present-sequence counter (the
//! parity-cards' observability primitive), and the kind-18 `COMPOSITE_TICK`
//! tick-delivery seam. It deliberately holds NO desktop policy — that stays
//! in the shim until the WM-server drain-out cards (WMS4–WMS6); this card
//! only puts the register the future userland WM will drive in place.
//!
//! Zero-regression contract (the WMS2 binding rule): when no WM is
//! registered nothing changes — the shell idle `drain` keeps compositing
//! exactly as today and every pre-M32 gate stays byte-identical. Only after
//! `REGISTER` does composite pacing move to the tick path (the shell guards
//! its idle `drain` call on `registered()`, one flag check on the hot path).
//!
//! Routing restriction (ADR 0009 D2): kind 18 `COMPOSITE_TICK` is the FIRST
//! routing-restricted kernel event kind — delivered EXCLUSIVELY to the
//! registered WM's process queue via `events.push`, never generated when no
//! WM is registered.
//!
//! No allocation, no libc, no POSIX — pure kernel BSS + the existing
//! `events` / `virtio_gpu` seams (both leaf modules, no import cycle).
//! WM-death teardown mirrors the `close_owner(pid)` window-teardown semantic
//! in the scheduler exit path: on WM process exit the kernel unregisters it
//! and pacing automatically falls back to the shell idle shim.
//!
//! M52 card 2 (#1239) adds the seat's INPUT-CAPTURE discipline to that
//! teardown. The WMS6/WMS8 drains moved the DECISION for the Alt+Tab
//! overlay, the mission-control grid, the tooltip, the notification panel
//! and the two modals into the WM while leaving the kernel holding the
//! applied state — so each is a CAPTURE held on the WM's behalf, and the
//! resumed shim has no path left to dismiss it (the shim decision was
//! drained/deleted). Seat release therefore clears them all, and every
//! routing point refuses a seat whose process descriptor says the process
//! is dead, so no event is ever delivered to a dead pid.

// once a seat is registered, and REQUEST_PRESENT is what transfers+flushes), so
// 1 Hz is the heartbeat, not necessarily the cadence. These counters measure
// rather than assume.
//
// The latency is deliberately split into its two halves, because they have
// different owners and different fixes:
//   * input sample -> REQUEST_PRESENT  = how long the WM's loop took to answer
//     (the WM's responsiveness; a WM that only presents on the tick shows ~1 s)
//   * REQUEST_PRESENT -> flushed       = the kernel + GPU cost of a present
// A single end-to-end number would hide which half is slow.
