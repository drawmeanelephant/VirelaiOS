//! VirelaiOS process abstraction (milestone four, card 3 — claim 3848).
//!
//! The task pool (scheduler.zig) is the EXECUTOR: context, TTBR0 switch,
//! quantum bookkeeping, zombie/reap. This module is the unit that owns the
//! PROGRAM — the loaded image, the address space it runs in, its lifecycle
//! state, and its exit status. A fixed BSS registry:
//! `max_processes` descriptors recycle like the pool slots do.
//!
//! What the process adds over the task:
//!   * The image descriptor (entry VA + content length) and the address
//!     space (root phys, text/stack VAs) travel WITH the process instead of
//!     living in exec's module globals.
//!   * The exit status is snapshotted at exit time and survives the task
//!     slot's reap — `procs` (and the exit report) can still show why a
//!     program died after the idle task freed its executor.
//!   * Per-process identity: every `exec` creates a NEW process descriptor,
//!     so `loaded()` and the table never hold a stale "last program".
//!   * The boot-time static EL0 payload registers as a process too, so one
//!     table shows both the payload's and the exec'd program's lifecycles.
//!
//! Lifecycle: free -> created (loaded, not yet bound) -> running (bound to
//! a live task) -> exited (the bound task became a zombie; status kept) ->
//! free (reaped). `create` takes the first free slot; when the registry is
//! full it recycles the OLDEST exited process (never a created/running
//! one). The scheduler's `exit_current` notifies this module (pure writes,
//! exception-context safe — the same report-pending pattern as the task
//! exit report); the shell idle loop drains the report via
//! `take_exit_report`.
//!
//! No libc, no POSIX, no scheduler import (the dependency
//! is one-way: scheduler -> process).
