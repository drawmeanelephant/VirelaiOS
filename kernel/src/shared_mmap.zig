//! M33 SB2 (claim 8878): the shared-anon MMU WIRING — the execution half of
//! the seam-B capability. `shared_region.zig` (SB1, claim 7418) DECIDES the
//! D2 grant/revoke rule as pure policy; this module EXECUTES it against real
//! page tables: writable leaves for the owner, EL0-RO `sw_cow` leaves for the
//! registered WM peer (mapped into the peer's OWN root at the peer's OWN va),
//! and unmap+unref on revoke — so the frozen policy stays pure and host-
//! testable while the physical side lives here.
//!
//! Model (ADR 0016 D1/D2, frozen by SB1):
//!   - The physical pages are allocated ONCE (contiguous, `alloc.alloc_pages`)
//!     and mapped into two roots via separate leaves: the owner's writable
//!     leaf (installed at create, tracked in the owner's `dynamic_pages` so
//!     exit frees them) and the peer's RO `sw_cow` leaf (ref'd 1->2, recorded
//!     as the region's single peer seat).
//!   - Teardown is D2 revocation: owner munmap/exit revokes the peer seat
//!     FIRST (unmap the peer's leaves, unref 2->1), then the owner's own
//!     teardown unrefs 1->0 and frees. A peer exit/munmap detaches only its
//!     seat (unref 2->1); the owner's writable leaf and the region survive
//!     (ADR 0016 D1: per-root teardown).
//!   - M52 card 3 (#1240): an owner-side revoke is COMPLETE — it also drops
//!     the peer's `mmap_region` row + armed read aperture (the mirror's
//!     kernel-side half, so no stale row can exhaust the peer's table) and
//!     ends any window bound to the dying surface (no zombie window blitting
//!     freed pages).
//!
//! No libc, no POSIX, no allocation — fixed BSS only.
