//! VirelaiOS tick-driven round-robin kernel task scheduler (claim 5275 —
//! the first milestone-three "tasks" card).
//!
//! Preemptive at the tick, or on an EL0 wake interrupting the demo worker:
//! the claim-9187 timer PPI enters the
//! claim-9746 EL1 IRQ vector, the GIC/timer chain runs (ack -> timer
//! handle/re-arm -> scheduler tick -> EOI), and the scheduler preempts the
//! current task for the next one. Claim 8215 extends the same fixed pool
//! with one EL0t task and no allocation: the shell keeps the handoff stack,
//! the EL1h worker has a static BSS stack, and the EL0 task has distinct
//! static EL1 exception and EL0 execution stacks.
//!
//! Why the switch is tiny:
//!   * The claim-9746 IRQ stubs already push the full register file (x0..
//!     x17 + x30, plus the claim-6729 callee-saved extension x19..x28 +
//!     x29) as a 256-byte "vector frame" on the interrupted task's stack,
//!     and pop it back before `eret`.
//!   * The scheduler therefore only saves/restores per task: the
//!     vector-frame pointer (sp), ELR_EL1 (interrupted PC) and SPSR_EL1
//!     (interrupted PSTATE). The frame pointer reaches the tick through
//!     `exceptions.resume_frame[c]` (staged by `exc_dispatch` at IRQ entry);
//!     the tick rewrites that global to the NEXT task's frame and programs
//!     ELR/SPSR, and the stub's `mov sp, x0` + register restore + `eret`
//!     lands in the next task exactly as if IT had been interrupted.
//!   * Claim 8215 also saves/restores SP_EL0. The exception dispatcher
//!     stages the source task's SP_EL0 and returns the selected task's value
//!     in x1; the vector exit installs it before `eret`. That is inert for
//!     EL1h tasks and essential for an EL0t task.
//!   * Round-robin: every tick preempts the current task; the next task
//!     resumes from wherever it was preempted.
//!
//! Console discipline: the scheduler itself never touches the console (IRQ
//! context — claim 9187). Worker progress is reported from the shell idle
//! loop via `maybe_report`, the same pattern as the timer heartbeat.
//!
//! Claim 5804: every task now owns a TTBR0 root. The EL1h shell/worker
//! share the EL1-only kernel root (identity map, zero EL0 leaves — also
//! the root runtime services run under); the EL0 task gets the user root
//! (text + stack only) and its entry/SP/witness are USER VAs, not kernel
//! addresses. The switch therefore programs TTBR0 + TLB-invalidates before
//! restoring ELR/SPSR.
//!
//! Claim 6729: the task lifecycle. Each pool slot carries an EXPLICIT
//! state: free -> ready -> running -> ready (preempted) -> zombie (exited)
//! -> free (reaped). `spawn` allocates the first free slot (bounded, no
//! dynamic allocation); `exit_current` (the sys_exit path) turns the
//! current task into a zombie; the scheduler-owned IDLE task (registered
//! at the last slot by `init`, always ready, WFE-parked) reaps one zombie
//! per iteration and the shell loop prints the reap. The idle task is the
//! ring's fallback, so an exit always has a successor and the pool drains
//! without a parent/child relationship. The monitor's `spawn` command
//! exercises runtime spawn with one dedicated demo stack.
//!
//! No libc, no POSIX, no allocation.

// The ready ring of core `c` is the set of tasks core `c` will run next:
// a task with state `.ready` sits on EXACTLY ONE core's ring (its "home").
// Selection claims (removes) the member, so two cores can never both
// select the same ready task — single-owner by construction, not by lock.
// Claim 881 slice 1 introduced the structure + the seeding seams
// (init/spawn/pin/reap) with the invariant checker; slice 2 rewired every
// rotation path (tick/switch_context/yield/sleep/wait/exit + the wake
// placement) onto ring claim/push, so the ring is now the scheduler's
// ONLY notion of "ready" — the shared slot scan is gone.
//
// Ring-home rules (frozen in the claim): spawns join ring 0 unless
// `pin_core` is set (then that ring — a pinned task never leaves it); a
// preempted/self-yielded task joins the ring of the core it ran on; a
// blocked task leaves its ring and wakes onto ring 0 (or its pin ring);
// an idle core steals from ANY other ring at the WFE->run seam and on
// every rotation path (issue #857 — the generalized steal: a ready task
// parked on another core's ring migrates to the core that needs work,
// unless it is pinned there). Capacity is the
// whole pool: every task could be ready at once.

// WM's pointer response was 786-1216 ms typical and 3004 ms worst, while a
// frame's own transfer+flush is ~0.3 ms. The scheduler only evaluates
// preemption at the 1 Hz period tick, so a task that becomes runnable just
// after a tick waits a uniformly distributed 0-1 s to execute.
//
// This block lands the MEASUREMENT of that demand and nothing else. The wake
// funnel records that a rotation is owed; every core-0 rotation records that it
// serviced one. No comparator is moved, no rotation is added, and no scheduling
// behaviour changes — with the request bookkeeping in place and no
// `timer.nudge()` behind it, a boot is exactly as schedulable as before. That
// is the `timer.nudge() disabled entirely -> PASS 2/2` probe from #1261's
// bisection, made permanent and observable.
//
// The nudge that would consume these counters (the comparator pull,
// `nudge_target`, the `period_tick` threading) is parked on draft PR #1255
// because it kills the SMP boot — `live-wnd5-gate2-policy` PASS -> FAIL, ending
// in a silent `VZVirtualMachine.State.error`. See #1252 and #1261. Landing the
// demand now means that when that defect is fixed, the win can be attributed to
// a measured number of owed rotations rather than asserted.
