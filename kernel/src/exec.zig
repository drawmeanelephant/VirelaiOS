//! VirelaiOS ESP exec (milestone-three card 6, claim 6783; extended by the
//! milestone-four follow-on claim 0826 — concurrent processes).
//!
//! Loads a real user program from the ESP and enters it at EL0. The
//! claim-8215 static EL0 payload is boot-registered; this module loads
//! programs read through the claim-6420 FAT path (`fat.read_file` over
//! virtio-blk): the file is a flat AArch64 image in the same DSK1 format
//! as KERNEL.BIN (`tools/elf2bin.py`, 24-byte header, content at offset
//! 24), built by `zig build user` and embedded on the ESP by the image
//! builder.
//!
//! Exec is the monitor command `exec [<file>]` (default `USER.BIN`):
//!
//!   1. Read the file (bounded). Two shapes: DSK1/DSK3/contiguous-ELF and
//!      PT_INTERP files transit the whole-file 2 MiB staging buffer
//!      (`exec_program_max`); a gap-layout static ELF — every GOOS=virelai
//!      Go binary — is instead parsed from a 16 KiB header window and has
//!      each segment STREAMED straight from the share into the pages that
//!      get mapped, so it is bounded by `exec_image_max` (32 MiB) on the file
//!      and by `elf.map_max` (64 MiB) on what it maps, rather than by that
//!      array (M70c-K, issue #1504; the mapped bound split out of the file
//!      bound in M72a, issue #1579).
//!   2. Validate the header (magic, entry offset, image size).
//!   3. Gate on CAPACITY (claim 0826 — the old `user_root_in_use` gate is
//!      gone: a second program loads and runs while the first is alive):
//!      the pool's free slot (checked FIRST, so a full pool never leaks
//!      pages or tables), the page-table carve-out (`table_full`), the
//!      process registry (`process_full`), and the physical allocator
//!      (`out_of_memory`).
//!   4. Allocate the program's OWN pages — 1 text page + 2 user-stack
//!      pages + 2 EL1 exception-stack pages from the physical allocator
//!      (claims 3972/5162) — copy the stripped content into the text page,
//!      and build the process's OWN TTBR0 user root with
//!      `mmu.build_user_root` (claim 5804: identity-tree clone + EL1-only
//!      kernel overlay + the text page at `userspace.text_va` + the user
//!      stack at the randomized `stack_va`). Works POST-install because the
//!      kernel stays identity-mapped (the VZ TTBR1 fallback), so
//!      `@intFromPtr` is still physical; the fresh clone tables are
//!      D-cache-cleaned before the scheduler's next TTBR0 switch. The
//!      process owns every page (freed at reap/recycle), and the boot-time
//!      static payload keeps its linked `.usertext`/`.userbss` pages.
//!   5. Create + bind the process (`process.zig`, claim 3848) and spawn it
//!      as an EL0t task (`scheduler.register_exec_user`) under the fixed
//!      syscall ABI — with its own EL1 exception stack, because two live
//!      user tasks cannot share the static one (a second task's vector
//!      frame would clobber the first's saved context).
//!
//! Card 3e (claim 4636), lifted by M71m (#1572): `exec <file> [arg...]`
//! packs a bounded argv block (8 args × 256 B, NUL-terminated, 255 bytes
//! usable, an over-long arg refused) into the process image. The flat DSK1
//! path still packs it into the process's OWN text page right after the
//! content — the text leaf is already EL0 read-only (W^X), so that block
//! is a READ-ONLY leaf. The gap-layout ELF path sizes the writable
//! segment's pages to cover the block (ADR 0007). `_start` receives argc
//! in x0 + the block VA in x1 (an entry-contract extension, NOT a syscall;
//! ADR 0007). More than 8 args, or one arg longer than 255 bytes, is an
//! honest refusal; a no-args exec packs nothing.
//!
//! The syscall/uaccess apertures are per process (armed at SVC entry from
//! the task's TCB, claim 0826), so `sys_write` bounds follow whichever
//! program issued the call. No libc, no POSIX, no heap allocation.
