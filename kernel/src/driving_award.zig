//! Milestone six card G5 (claim 1543) — Driving Award, the window manager.
//!
//! A bounded window registry (fixed BSS, no heap) with z-order, focus,
//! hit-testing, and a dirty-rect compositor that blits window buffers into
//! the G1 framebuffer (kernel/src/virtio_gpu.zig). Road Pops — the G3 boot
//! terminal (kernel/src/text.zig, kernel/src/road_pops.zig) — is the FIRST
//! window (window 0, a full-screen terminal); a second demo window (a 1 Hz
//! clock) overlaps its top-right corner and proves multiple windows with
//! distinct content + focus.
//!
//! Z-order is the registry array order (index 0 = bottom, the last index =
//! top). `raise` moves a window to the top; focus is tracked by window id
//! (stable across raises), and `hit_test` returns the TOPMOST visible window
//! containing a point. The compositor repaints from the lowest dirty window
//! upward — a genuine dirty-rect redraw: a window whose content did not
//! change is never repainted, and the scanout transfer + flush run once per
//! dirty batch (the G1/G2/G3 full-frame present discipline).
//!
//! Window 0 (the terminal) renders the shared text layer straight into the
//! scanout framebuffer (its "buffer" IS the framebuffer — a terminal
//! redraws its full client area, which here is the whole screen). Window 1
//! (the clock) renders into its own fixed BSS back-buffer, which the
//! compositor blits over the terminal. Because the terminal's repaint
//! covers the clock's region, the compositor repaints from the lowest dirty
//! window UP, so the clock is always re-blitted over a freshly repainted
//! terminal — the classic overlay-preserving order.
//!
//! Input routing (the I3 path): keyboard bytes reach the Road Pops line
//! editor only while the terminal window is focused (`terminal_focused`);
//! when another window holds focus the keystrokes simply queue in the input
//! FIFO until the terminal regains focus. Serial (the scripted evidence
//! channel) stays an always-wired fallback, unchanged.
//!
//! No libc, no POSIX, no allocation, no function pointers in any const
//! table (the claim-0015 discipline — the registry is a BSS array built at
//! runtime).
//!
//! Host tests pin the pure contracts: hit-test, z-order/raise, focus, the
//! repaint-from-lowest-dirty plan, the clock rendering, and the blit.

// M76a (#1674): the splash-to-seat handoff hold.
//
// render_splash leaves `splash_hold` standing: while it stands,
// composite() refuses every kernel present (no transfer+flush), so the
// splash frame stays exactly where the last flush put it — the tee keeps
// writing the text layer into the framebuffer underneath, but the pixels
// do not move until the handoff resolves. The hold ends on the first of:
//
//   * the seat binding the scanout (`wm_owns_user_layer`, set by
//     wm_server.scanout_bind) — the seat paints through its OWN present
//     path (wm_server.request_present), which is never suppressed, so the
//     screen goes splash -> seat in one frame with zero kernel-art frames
//     between. The serial ordering for that happy path is carried by the
//     seat's own markers (go-dogfood: `wm: autostart` ->
//     `gotabwm: registered` -> `gotabwm: seat-taken`).
//   * the BOUND: `splash_bound_ticks` timer ticks (1 Hz) after the first
//     idle evaluation — one honest klog line naming what was waited for,
//     then Road Pops presents as before. The bound is stated in (and
//     gated by) tools/gate/specs/live-roadpops.spec. Every no-seat
//     outcome lands exactly as today, honestly and on time: share mode
//     `none` (`GOTABWM.ELF not on the share`), `settings wm none`, and a
//     seat that loads but never binds all reach the bound and say so.
//
// Headless boots never engage the hold: render_splash early-returns when
// the gpu never armed, and the hold is only set on the path that actually
// pushed a splash frame. No timing is tuned by feel — the bound is one
// named constant, and the spec asserts both its arithmetic and its line.
// The M59 invariant is untouched: this changes pixels only; the `wm` and
// `shell` compiled defaults, the monitor, and the serial seam are all
// exactly where they were (every line still reaches klog/uart first).
