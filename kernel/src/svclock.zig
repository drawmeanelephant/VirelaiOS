//! VirelaiOS service-domain locks (claim 9498 follow-on: per-subsystem
//! locking so syscalls on different cores contend only when they touch the
//! SAME subsystem).
//!
//! The claim-9498 coarse gate restored the single-core semantic over ALL
//! shared user-visible service state, which serialized unrelated domains
//! (the in-guest compiler's file I/O starved window/net/event syscalls).
//! This module replaces it with one IRQ-masking, holder-tracked lock per
//! service domain, plus a canonical ACQUISITION ORDER that makes every
//! multi-lock path deadlock-free:
//!
//!     file < net < win < ev < kernel
//!
//! - Domain syscalls hold exactly ONE domain lock: FILE (virtio_file,
//!   file_table, exec loads), NET (virtio_net/udp/tcp/arp/dhcp/dns),
//!   WIN (driving_award, wnd_core chrome, the text/font layer), EV
//!   (events, mailbox, app_timers, wm_server).
//! - The `kernel` lock (the old coarse gate) covers everything else:
//!   the process registry + lifecycle, mmap/shared_mmap, clipboard,
//!   audio, pipes, and monitor commands' kernel-state reads.
//! - Multi-lock paths acquire their domains in canonical order and may
//!   end with `kernel`: the exit/fault teardown takes all five; exec
//!   takes FILE then KERNEL; the IRQ tick's protected work takes EV
//!   then KERNEL (try-only, rotation never waits). A nested path may
//!   also take `kernel` while holding an EARLIER domain — uaccess
//!   write-page resolution inside a socket/file syscall takes KERNEL
//!   under NET/FILE — because `kernel` is last, that is still the
//!   canonical direction.
//! - `kernel` is the LAST service-domain lock, and the scheduler's own
//!   locks nest under all five (scheduler.zig: `sched_lock` is brief,
//!   ring locks innermost). The total order is therefore
//!
//!     file < net < win < ev < kernel < sched_lock < ring locks
//!
//! - A path that would take a LOWER-ranked lock while holding a higher
//!   one may NOT: it releases its held bits, takes the needed set
//!   canonically, and re-acquires its bits so the outer caller's paired
//!   release stays balanced (`sys_thread`'s exit op inside a
//!   KERNEL-holding dispatch, monitor `time`'s nested exec — both do
//!   release_set(held_bits()) / acquire_set(...) around the nested
//!   path), or it defers the work to a lock-free beat (the exit-kill
//!   conversion's non-prefix guard). kernel/tests/lock_order_test.zig
//!   drives the real dispatchers through the acquire-order witness
//!   below to keep this rule enforced.
//!
//! Why IRQ-masking matters (the claim-2369/9498 lesson): a holder whose
//! IRQs stay enabled can be preempted mid-critical-section, and a masked
//! spinner on the same core would wait forever. Masking IRQs for the whole
//! hold means a holder always runs to completion, so any context — SVC
//! (already masked), main, fault/exception (masked) — may spin safely.
//! Cross-core contention is bounded by the holder completing.
//!
//! Locks are NOT reentrant: nested acquisition is caller-managed through
//! `held()`, exactly like the claim-9498 gate. The IRQ tick (core 0/1,
//! compositor/app-timer/CPU-limit work) may not spin on a lock it could
//! never release; it uses the `try_*` paths and skips that work.
//!
//! The core count is a literal and the core id is read host-guarded from
//! MPIDR_EL1, exactly like claim 7339's `resume_cores` — importing smp
//! here would cycle smp -> exceptions -> svclock -> smp (exceptions must
//! lock its demand-paging path).
//!
//! No libc, no POSIX, no allocation.
