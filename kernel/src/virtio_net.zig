//! VirelaiOS virtio-pci network transport (milestone five, card N1 —
//! claim 1373).
//!
//! Drives the device the runner attaches as `VZVirtioNetworkDeviceConfiguration`
//! under `--net <capture-file>` — to the guest a modern virtio-pci net
//! device (VID 0x1af4, DID 0x1041, virtio device ID 1) on bus 0, found via
//! the MCFG ECAM base exactly like the console (0x1043, claim 0013), block
//! (0x1042, claim 6420) and entropy (0x1044, claim 2665) devices. The
//! 2026-08-11 DID correction established the modern DID = Virtio Device ID
//! + 0x1040 scheme, so modern virtio-net = **0x1041**; the transitional
//! form 0x1001 is also accepted (the console's 0x1003 precedent) and
//! whatever DID is OBSERVED is recorded in the `net` report (confirm-at-
//! claim-time — a differing DID is a claim-time finding, recorded as the
//! 6420/2665 corrections were).
//!
//! The transport mirrors the blk/entropy patterns: discovery + capability
//! walk + feature negotiation + split-ring queue setup run PRE-EXIT
//! (post-exit config-space reads hang on VZ, claim 0013); post-MMU the
//! transport is RE-ARMED (the claim-6420/2665 lesson — VZ resets virtio
//! devices at ExitBootServices, so status reads 0 and the queues are dead
//! until the re-arm) and TX runs only after that re-arm.
//!
//! N1 negotiates VIRTIO_F_VERSION_1 (mandatory) and VIRTIO_NET_F_MAC when
//! offered (the host-set address — the runner fixes the MAC on the host
//! config so the guest read is deterministic and gate-assertable); NO
//! offload/checksum features are negotiated, so a TX buffer is the RAW
//! ETHERNET FRAME with no virtio_net_hdr prefix (the transitional reading:
//! QEMU's reference device strips a 12-byte header only when checksum
//! offload is negotiated — see `tx_hdr_len`, a confirm-at-claim-time
//! constant). Queue 0 = RX, queue 1 = TX per the virtio-net spec §5.2.
//! N1 (claim 1373) proved the transport + TX; card N2 (claim 6076)
//! adds the RX path: queue 0 is supplied with a fixed BSS buffer
//! (one-request-at-a-time like TX), the used ring is drained POLLED
//! (the proven N1/blk shape — the net device's used-buffer IRQ line is
//! NOT yet observed on this platform; whether the device delivers one,
//! and via what INTID, is a claim-time finding recorded in `net`/the
//! claim, not assumed), accepted frames land in a bounded FIFO (no
//! heap, the card-3d push/drain pattern, drop-oldest overflow), and
//! `net recv` prints them. MAC filtering accepts own + broadcast and
//! drops the rest (a counter in the `net` report). The RX buffer is
//! sized with a 12-byte virtio_net_hdr headroom (N1 observed the device
//! CONSUMES one on TX; whether the device WRITES one into RX buffers is
//! pinned from observation at claim time — `net: rx-obs` records the
//! first frame's device-written length + first bytes, and `rx_hdr_len`
//! is corrected like `tx_hdr_len` was (0→12) if the observation
//! differs). Card N3 (claim 7293) adds the ARP protocol layer
//! (`kernel/src/arp.zig`, pure logic): the RX drain dispatches ARP
//! frames — a request for our static IP is answered (the reply is built
//! in `tx_staging` and transmitted on the N1 TX path), a reply is
//! learned into the bounded table, and `net ip`/`net arp` drive the
//! static address + resolution. Honest bounds: IPv4-only ARP, no DHCP,
//! no IP stack (N4).
//!
//! The logic is host-testable through injectable transport ops (the
//! fat.zig injected-sector-I/O pattern): feature selection, MAC read,
//! frame build, staging bounds and used-ring drain accounting are pure
//! functions over an `Ops` struct the tests mock; the real device binding
//! is a thin layer of fn pointers over the mmio/pci/mmu helpers.
//!
//! No libc, no POSIX, no allocation, no interrupts.
