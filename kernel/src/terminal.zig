//! VirelaiOS terminal (vt) seam (ADR 0020, issue #1072).
//!
//! A **terminal** is a bounded, hardware-free session buffer: an output ring
//! the owner process writes to, an input queue a front-end fills, and an
//! exclusive attach state naming the front-end (the raw serial console, a
//! TABWM window, a TCP/SSH session). It is the thing `GOSH.ELF`, `TERM.BIN`,
//! and remote sessions all sit on — see ADR 0020.
//!
//! Pure by construction: fixed arrays, no allocation, no hardware, no
//! syscalls. The device/front-end wiring lives outside this module (the
//! `/dev/tty` routing in `file_table.zig` is the next tranche).
//!
//! Overflow policy is explicit and counted:
//!   * output full -> drop the OLDEST byte (`out_dropped`), so output flows
//!     (serial/net). The window path never hits this: `writeWindow` streams
//!     write→grid in ring-sized chunks (#1630, M73f-1), so a TUI frame
//!     larger than the ring cannot drop;
//!   * input full  -> drop the NEWEST byte (`in_dropped`), so a key burst
//!     never evicts keys the owner has not read yet.
