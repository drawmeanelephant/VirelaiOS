## Milestones

All milestones through M52 are complete. Closed-milestone detail is under
`docs/archive/` and in the per-arc `docs/march-m*.md` trackers; open cards, if
any, are on the GitHub tracker.

| 51 | SSH | Userland SSH-2 client `SSH.BIN`; real-OpenSSH interop; ADR 0025 | ✅ 2026-09-12 |
| 52 | Client-death hardening | Exit/revoke teardown pinned end-to-end: a client dying with focus, a drag, or a bound surface leaves no zombie window, stale mapping, stuck capture, or dead-seat routing (umbrella #1237) | ✅ 2026-09-14 |
| 53 | TLS 1.3 client + trust store | In-tree TLS 1.3 end to end: HKDF/SHA-384/AES-GCM, X.509 + chain validation, RSA/ECDSA verification, the handshake state machine; real interop against 4 peer implementations and 8 public endpoints, 5 negatives fail closed; ADR 0029. #1336: `task_stack_size` 32 → 192 KiB so a live handshake completes (`FETCHS.BIN` → `GOFETCH.ELF`/`WEB.ELF`, gates `go-fetch-https`, `live-web` boot 12; `live-tls13` retired). #1337: git-over-https — `GOTGIT.ELF` clones in-process over `tls.Dial` (gate `go-git`) | ✅ 2026-09-14; stack 2026-09-16; git-over-https 2026-09-16 |
| 54 | Go carries its first app | A Go EL0 program owns a raw ADR 0007 window (`GOWIN.ELF`, gate `go-win`), an independent Go `.tabs` v2 codec round-trips the TABWM session format (`tools/go/tabcodec`), and `WEB.ELF` renders in-guest over `user/go/webrender`; kernel untouched (umbrella #1244) | ✅ 2026-09-15 |
| 56 | Finish the Go SDK (`vi` + `tabapp`) | The Go EL0 SDK is complete enough to be a WM: `vi` gains IPC 5/6 + `procs` discovery, the tab-client WM_RPC wire, and addr-hinted mmap; `user/go/widgets` adds text/button/list; `user/go/tabapp` + a demo app run one Go tab full-viewport in Zig TABWM (gate `go-tabapp`) | ✅ 2026-09-15 (gate `go-tabapp` green on VZ) |
| 59 | Default flip (#1298) | The **boot default is the Go seat**: `wm` is a schema-v2 settings key whose compiled default is `gotabwm`, so a boot with no persisted value autostarts `GOTABWM.ELF` and hosts `GOCALC.ELF` plus the Go editor `NOTE.ELF` over WM_RPC (then still Zig NOTEPAD; the Zig binary is gone since M66c/#1485); `settings set wm tabwm` keeps the Zig seat as the reachable fallback and `none` is the explicit shim-only VM (gate `go-wm-default`, 2/2 runs: the untouched default boot, then the persisted fallback) | ✅ 2026-09-15 (gate `go-wm-default` green on VZ) |
| 60 | Starve Zig EL0 (#1297) | No new `user/src/*.zig` apps (ADR 0030). Leftovers deleted: `EDIT.BIN` → `GOEDIT.ELF` (gate `go-edit`); `FILE.BIN` → `GOFILES.ELF` (gate `go-files`, #1374); `CALC.BIN` → `GOCALC.ELF` (gate `go-calc`, #1378, deleted M62h / #1406); `NOTEPAD.BIN` (M66c/#1485, PR #1495); `SH.BIN` → `GOSH.ELF` (M68b #1450: serial + trust + scripting + net/handshake, then the delete); `FETCHS.BIN` → `GOFETCH.ELF`/`WEB.ELF` (M71k/#1570, gates `go-fetch-https`, `live-web` boot 12; `lib/tls` is host-side interop only); `SETTINGS.BIN` → `GOSET.ELF` (M71f/#1565, gate `go-wm-default` boot 01); `TOP.BIN` + `SYSMON.BIN` → `GOTOP.ELF` (M71g/#1566, gate `go-top`); `VIEW.BIN` → `GOVIEW.ELF` (M71h/#1567, gate `live-image-viewer` + `go-wm-seat` run 04); `DOC.BIN` → `WEB.ELF` (M71i/#1568, gates `live-web` + `live-web-ttf`; `lib/html` and its 21 host tests went with it). `PING.BIN` → `GOPING.ELF` (M71n/#1573, gates `live-n1-ping`, `live-net-offline`, `go-net-clis`). `TABWM.BIN` is **retained by decision** as the Zig fallback (M68c #1451, ADR 0034) — not a leftover: `wm=tabwm` is a schema-v2 settings value, and gate `go-wm-default` 4/4 boots it (run 02). SSH stays `SSH.BIN`. | ✅ 2026-09-21 (EDIT/FILE/CALC/NOTEPAD/SH/FETCHS deleted; TABWM retained — ADR 0034) |
| 61 | Guest self-test (#1380) | `GOSELF.ELF` runs in-OS cases and writes `/host/SELFTEST/…` (report + intake copies + file-ABI receipts + window receipt); host only boots it and byte-compares via `share-equals`/`share-contains`; ADR 0031/0032 | ✅ 2026-09-17 |
| 63 | GOTABWM HID (#1418) | Boot-default seat drains kind 19/21; pin/Alt+Tab; rail click; type into GOEDIT (share `seed-line\nXYZ`); HID drag-reorder is `go-wm-hid` run 02 (not `go-wm-tabs` M62d choreography). Dual path ADR 0009. Runner `ctrl-tab` is hidChord (#1424). | ✅ 2026-09-18 (`go-wm-hid` 2/2, `go-wm-seat` 2/2, `go-wm-tabs` 3/3, `go-wm-default` 2/2) |
| 65 | Go threads (ADR 0027) | M65a–d landed (#1472/#1473/#1474/#1475), ADR 0007 slots 73/74 frozen, max_tasks 16 (3 + 3×4 + 1 spare) | ✅ 2026-09-18 (`go-wm-tabs` 3/3, `go-wm-seat` 2/2, `live-scale` 1/1) |
| 66 | Go owns files (storage depth) | M66a (#1443): `/host` as a surface Go can trust — honest HF error rows (`hf_open_errno`/`hf_handle_errno`: not-found/is-dir/exists/handle-full), fsync at EL0 (slot 77, ADR 0007 amendment), `vi.FileWriteAll` confirmed-count chunking, GOSELF append/bigwrite/clamp/fsync/errors receipts. M66b (#1444): crash-safe settings round-trip — `SETTINGS.TXT` saves via temp+fsync+rename (never in-place truncation; the no-overwrite HF rename makes the publish delete-then-rename), corrupt file refused whole (no valid `#v` header → defaults), `vi.FileRename`/`WriteFileSafe`, GOTABWM session/layout onto the safe path + seat-side fail-closed decode; `go-wm-default` corrupt-settings run heals byte-exact. M66c (#1445): the fleet's default editor client is the Go `NOTE.ELF` — 22 lifecycle/WM-host specs retargeted onto it, `image/apps.txt`'s dock entry, `gotabwm`'s title→binary map, and the monitor's `help editor` line (which named `NOTEPAD.BIN` and listed `EDIT.BIN`-era chords no shipped editor implements; now pinned by `live-help`). M66c follow-on (#1485): `NOTEPAD.BIN` **deleted** — `user/src/notepad.zig` and its build step gone, and the 14 specs that still exec'd it retargeted onto `NOTE.ELF` (9 mechanical: staging block + `note:` prefix + the two app-painted colour expectations in `live-wm4-paint`/`live-wm-*-chrome`) or retired with a coverage note (2 token boots; the theme table stays pinned by SYSMON/DEVCONS). The three contracts only the Zig app had moved to `GOEDIT.ELF` (find/goto, WIN_UNSAVED save-and-exit) and a new `GOCOMP.ELF` (clipboard+timer composition). Review fixes (PR #1495): GOEDIT publishes through M66b's `vi.WriteFileSafe` (temp+fsync+rename; a failed publish exits 1, not 0); the tab specs' coords were re-pinned off the retired app's rect onto the host's own (TOP declares 40,40) — `live-tabstrip` `STRIP_OK` (dividers=11, underline=118, close_red=19) and `live-tabclick` 3/3, superseding the "tree-side red" read, which was that coordinate bug. | ✅ 2026-09-19 (M66a ✅, M66b ✅, M66c retarget ✅, deletion ✅, review fixes ✅) |
| 67 | Go owns net | M67a (#1446): `vi` Dial/Send/Recv + DNS. M67b (#1447): GOFETCH/GOTGIT/WEB HTTPS in-process via `tls.Dial` over `vi.Dial` (shelf #1497); `FETCHS.BIN` → `GOFETCH.ELF`/`WEB.ELF` (gates `go-fetch-https`, `live-web` boot 12). M67c (#1448): class-B `go-fetch-https` pins the happy path plus name/expired/chain fail-closed; M71k/#1570 deleted `FETCHS.BIN` (`live-tls13` retired). | ✅ 2026-09-21 (M67a–c ✅; deletion M71k/#1570) |
| 69 | Daily driver floor | Go-seat dogfood + screenshot→site honesty + chrome cohesion + intentional typefaces + edit→build→run loop (not full self-host) + GOSH daily-bar gaps; index #1527 closed. M69g (#1558): kernel chrome skip for a fully occluded window so GOTABWM's 8,8 client-death probe no longer paints over GOSH's prompt; `go-dogfood` third boot PIXEL-asserts terminal-green on the tab's first line. | ✅ 2026-09-20 |
| 70 | Moonshots (#1437) | M70d #1456: fidelity corpus landed PR #1513 (nine pages host-goldened in `user/go/webrender/golden_test.go`; its in-VM rung moved to `live-web` boot 14 when M71i #1568 retired `DOC.BIN`); JS-in-WASM **measured negative** (Elk 22763 B inspect-clean, `exec` traps at `max_frames=32`; MIT engines miss 64 KiB / need wasm EH) — ADR 0028 D2 amended. M70g G2 (#1459, PR #1488): `--console-tcp` hardened — `busy` refusal, pre-auth deadline, line bound, stall drop, mid-line `^C` cancel, `--console-tcp-secret-file`; ADR 0022 D2 amended; `live-console-tcp`/`live-remote-console` run 03. M70g G3 (#1459): restore beyond same-process measured — cross-process restore **works** (`--vz-restore-save`/`--vz-restore-load`; VZ enforces the saved `machineIdentifier`), virtio-gpu + USB HID PASS, USB MSD 8/9 (one unreproduced refusal), custom-virtio **refused**; rows in `hardware-contract.md`, `live-vz-restore` runs save/load/gpu/usb/msd/cvc. G1 (in-guest sshd) unclaimed, blocked on M68 #1436. M70c (#1455): **complete** — all three shards landed: S1 the guest's own `cmd/compile` compiles the pinned hello (PR #1551), S2 the in-guest build loop (PR #1552, class-B `live-selfhost-go` 2/2), S3 the Zig dialect's `break`/`continue` in all three loop forms with the body's open defers unwound on the jump (PR #1511, `live-zc` run 02 + the `s3` corpus dual-run); what stays host-provided — the toolchain payload, and `GOVIRELAI_STD` still opt-in — is D4's boundary, recorded in ADR 0035 amendment 9. M70c-K (#1504): the exec bound moved — a 9.5 MiB `GOOS=virelai` image (8.4 MiB of it initialized data) now streams into its mapped pages and prints its banner read back from 1/4/8 MiB into the payload (`go-hello` run 02, 3/3), while staged shapes keep the 2 MiB buffer and oversized/truncated files still refuse by name. M70c (#1455, ADR 0035 amendment 2): with #1504 landed the exec blocker is retired and the remaining one is named with evidence — the fork has no `syscall`/`os` for `GOOS=virelai` at all (`GOOS=virelai go build fmt` fails in `src/syscall`/`internal/poll`), filed as **#1525** (M70c-S1P). **#1525 landed the port**: `GOOS=virelai go build fmt` (and `os`) now compiles — `tools/go/overlay/{syscall,internal/syscall/unix,internal/poll,time,os}` over the ADR 0007 slots, POSIX flag/errno/struct surface, honest ENOSYS for spawn/signal/net — the runtime's `os_sigpipe` linkname was added (the port's first LINK-time gap), and the std fixture `tools/go/gosyscall.go` builds and loads on VZ, but its in-guest run died in `mallocinit` (filed as **#1540**, M70c-S1L). **#1540 landed the run**: the break base now starts past the argv+envp block the kernel packs into the data segment's tail page (`initBlocFloor`), which is what the kernel's `mmap_collides` span was refusing (ADR 0035 amendment 4 corrects amendment 3: the segment shift was a coincidence — the real boundary is the data segment's page slack vs the 2304-byte block, i.e. `r > 1792`), and `go-hello` **run 05** is the first std-importing program to execute: `os.Mkdir`/`WriteFile`/`ReadDir`/`Stat`/`Remove` plus a 9.5 MiB `os.File` read whose 32-bit FNV the host recomputes off the share. The run also caught two port bugs no compile-time check could (the POSIX→kernel open-flag word, and `O_TRUNC` routed through the port's by-path `Truncate` = ENOSYS, i.e. every `os.WriteFile`). Meanwhile the transfer half is measured, not guessed: `go-hello` run 04 has the guest read a 9.5 MiB image out of the share in 4,641 calls at the 2048-byte EL0 read cap (~30 MB/s, hash re-checked on macOS). **#1543 landed the in-guest build**: the guest's own `cmd/compile` and `cmd/link` compile the pinned hello to a `virelai` object, link it into an ELF that passes every loader rule the kernel enforces, and run it to its pinned lines (`go-hello` runs 06-08, 8/8 with runs 01-05 re-run under the changed port) — the wall was not the acceptance bound but the port's missing file position (`cmd/internal/bio` seeks on package archives and on the object it writes; ADR 0035 amendment 7), and the in-guest footprint is sampled at ~33 MiB during the compile and ~131 MiB during the link of a 65,215-frame guest. **#1544 landed the build loop**: the guest's own `cmd/compile` and `cmd/link` build the pinned fixture inside ONE boot, sequenced by the guest's own spawn-and-wait rather than by the monitor (compile 2.0 s, link 14.0 s), and the gate's second boot runs the product it built (`live-selfhost-go`, 2/2) — the #1544 spike needed no new spawn slot (ADR 0035 amendment 6), and the loop keeps two children plus a monitor `exec` because that shape is proven green, not because three children are known to fail — the third-child death did not reproduce in the shape that produced it, so the wall is uncharacterised and no open card owns it (ADR 0035 amendment 8; #1449 closed). | ✅ 2026-09-20 (index #1437 closed) |
| 71 | Seat honesty | Default Go seat stops lying: hosted GOSH paints, scanout fill, rail chrome, M48 tab depth on GOTABWM, catalog deletions; index #1559; cards #1560–#1573. | 🔄 |
| 72 | Charm TUI | Window tty Charm can speak (SGR/CUP/EL/ED/alt screen), `load_max` not charging BSS, a tiny Bubble Tea hello whose proof is a 2560×1440 scanout, host VHS of that window; index #1578; cards #1579–#1582. Not a vendor dump. M72a (#1579): the loader's single bound was charged on `Σ memsz`, which is why a Go image carrying 32 MiB of `.noptrbss` (the FIPS scratch buffer every Charm-sized binary drags in) was refused as `segment_too_large` while costing no file bytes — split into `load_max` (32 MiB of INITIALIZED bytes, `Σ filesz`) and a new `map_max` (64 MiB of MAPPED bytes, `Σ memsz`, which this loader eagerly allocates and zeroes, so it is a RAM budget); the new refusal is named end to end (`map_too_large`, and never the "staging buffer" sentence the fall-through told about a gap-layout static ELF that would have streamed). `go-hello` runs 11-12 are the class-B: a 9,582,729 B Go file whose segments map 51,559,756 B EXECS and reads both ends of its 42,108,744 B `.noptrbss` tail back (`datapages=12337` held to `ceil(RW p_memsz/4096) + 1` on the host), and the same bytes with `p_memsz` at 1 GiB are refused by the new name with `staging buffer` absent. M72b (#1580): the bound window grid has 16-colour SGR/CUP/EL/ED, an alternate screen, and DECTCEM; `live-term` captures the real scanout. M72c (#1581): a tiny Bubble Tea v2 model writes into that bound tty; two Virelai-only platform stubs are compiler overlays over module-cache source, never an in-tree vendor dump. M72d (#1582): `tools/charmhello-tape.sh` records the real scanout as an artifact PNG sequence (optional host GIF), never guest video or a host ANSI render. | 🔄 2026-09-21 (M72a ✅; M72b–d in review) |
| 78 | Final Zig user-source inventory (#1685) | M78a–d retire 10 superseded/orphan Zig apps; 62 top-level survivors classified by gate/ADR; six live gates retargeted and green | ✅ 2026-09-24 |

> M40 (the gate-fleet consolidation, issue #934, done 2026-09-06) was a tooling
> workstream, not a product milestone; M36 was skipped.

> Issue #1338 (2026-09-15) is likewise tooling: the class-B harness now refuses

| **M58 — Move the apps you touch** | M58a–f landed: files, GOEDIT (`go-edit`), GOTERM (`go-term`, #1307), fetch, FART. `GOCALC.ELF` (gate `go-calc`, #1378) is the CALC successor. Full-viewport via tabapp in Zig TABWM. | |
| **M60 leftovers** | Policy recorded; `EDIT.BIN`, `FILE.BIN`, `CALC.BIN`, `NOTEPAD.BIN`, `SH.BIN` (#1450), `FETCHS.BIN` (#1570), `SETTINGS.BIN` (#1565), `TOP.BIN`/`SYSMON.BIN` (#1566, one successor `GOTOP.ELF`), `VIEW.BIN` (#1567), `DOC.BIN` (#1568, successor `WEB.ELF`), and `PING.BIN` (#1573, successor `GOPING.ELF`) are gone. `TABWM.BIN` is **retained by decision** (ADR 0034 / M68c #1451) as the `settings set wm tabwm` fallback — frozen, bug-fix only. | |
| **EL0 `sys_exec` caller survival** | AddrSpaceSpec + argv on slot 28; class-B `live-el0-exec` | #1333 |
| **M71 — Seat honesty** | Seat lane + first app retirements landed: M71c–e (chrome, reopen/duplicate, freeze + start surface), M71f `GOSET.ELF` (#1565), M71g `GOTOP.ELF` (#1566), M71h `GOVIEW.ELF` (#1567), M71i `DOC.BIN` → `WEB.ELF` (#1568), M71n `GOPING.ELF` + GOSH names the net CLIs (#1573, gates `live-n1-ping`/`live-net-offline`/`go-net-clis`). M71m (#1572): exec argv is 8×256, an over-long arg is refused, GOSSHD runs `GOSH.ELF -c` directly (gate `live-ssh-server`) | #1559 |
| **M72 — Charm TUI** | Closed (#1578, all cards): loader bound split (`load_max` initialized / `map_max` 64 MiB mapped), window-tty VT (SGR/CUP/EL/ED/alt), Bubble Tea hello + host tape. The `u8` grid leftover moved to M73a-1. | #1578 |
| **M73 — Terminal depth** | In flight: index #1624 + 14 cards; acceptance #1638 closes it. Merged: M73a-1, M73f-1, M73b (#1647), M73a-2 (#1649), M73f-2 (#1651), M73c (#1627), M73e (#1652), M73g (#1653), M73h (#1654), M73i (#1656), M73k (#1637), M73l (#1661, PR #1666). This PR closes M73m #1662 (palette theming: `theme=custom` + `palette_fg/bg/accent` resolved at paint, chosen in GOSET, applied live). M73j #1636 is claimed; M73z #1638 landed (class-B `go-dogfood` 4/4 — boot 04 drives the acceptance chain: tab close → launcher → GOTERM → drag-select → copy/paste/run → `tty` 0/0 → `r` resize 64x23 → lower → pixel capture; seat `maxTicks` 90 + exit sweep, `--input-key` marker-anchored delivery). | #1624 |
| **M74 — TUI apps** | Split out of M73 wave 2: milestone 55 + index #1639 filed. M74a `GOFILES.ELF` Bubble Tea file manager landed (#1644, gate `go-fileman`). | #1639 |
| **M79 — Go seat depth + appkit** | In flight: persistent live seat and appkit foundation landed; tab chrome/navigation/session and app-interface cards remain. | #1703 |
| **M79k — notify** | Landing (PR #1784): WM_RPC kind 12 `notify` (24-byte title is the whole text budget), a bounded 4-deep toast queue in the seat with a 3-step Surface→Bg fade over its last 3 ticks, bottom-left stack clear of the rail and the clock panel, click-to-focus through the same `focusHosted` seam alt-tab uses, and `tabapp.Notify`/`vi.Notify` with GOFILES as the adopter (a toast on a completed copy). Markers: `gotabwm: notify id=` / `notify paint id=` / `notify dismiss id=` / `notify drop n=`. `go-wm-seat` run 06 proves the chain end to end with a kind-4 snapshot pixel assert. | #1720 |
| **M79e — nav kinds 9/10** | Landed (PR #1758): the seat serves nav-declare/nav-poll, `Ctrl+Shift+[` / `]` steps per-tab history, GOFILES is the first live adopter. `go-wm-tabs` run 08 proves the round trip. `hid.go` overlaps #1747 by agreement; that claim rebases on top. | #1708 |
| **M80 — Terminal you can live in** | In flight: index #1716 + 14 cards. Landed: M80a–e, M80g, M80h, and M80k (#1727 — Ctrl+Shift+K clears the scrollback (ED 3) + snaps to tail, Ctrl+Shift+R soft reset, Ctrl+Shift+Alt+R full RIS; kernel chrome chords, `help terminal`). | #1716 |
| **M80i — font zoom** | Landing: one `font_size` key (small/medium/large) moves both ladders — text and the bound terminal grid (rasterized 11/13/17 px, cells 7×13 / 8×16 / 10×21), re-flows bound screens and notifies owners (WIN_RESIZE); `font` reports both ladders and sets the rung, GOSET cycles it. Class-B `live-term-depth` runs 04/05 (one snapshot per boot — flake fixup tracked in #1757). | #1725 |
| **M81 — Files as a platform** | In flight: index #1781 + 7 cards. Landed: M81b (#1762 — one `mime` table: magic bytes first, extension second, printable-text last; one handler registry with GOVIEW.ELF + GOEDIT.ELF as the first two adopters. GOFILES' Enter / `l` / double-click dispatch a file and `o` lists the candidates; a type nothing opens is refused by name. `go-selftest` grew the `mime` case (write → read back → sniff → receipt), `go-fileman` run 02 the guest launch proof), M81g (#1767 — `virelai/snapshot` is a length-framed bundle whose header carries the ENTRY COUNT, so a container cut short is refused at any cut point, not just mid-entry; the seat takes one on `Ctrl+Shift+S` and restores it only against a one-shot `/host/SNAPSHOT.RESTORE`, rehydrating the share so the boot's ordinary `loadSettings`/`loadSession` do the reading. `go-wm-default` boots 05-09 are the drill: saved `bytes=321 entries=4 docs=2`, restored byte-exact (`share-equals`), corrupt → `snapshot bad header`, absent → `snapshot missing`, nothing written either way. `go-selftest` case 18 re-parses the published bundle with an independent host reader and compares every rehydrated entry to the seeded input). | #1781 |
| **M82 — The app platform** | In flight: index #1782 + 8 cards. Landed: M82a (#1768 — `image/apps.txt` is a versioned ADDITIVE schema: fields 1–4 are the v1 shape every reader already parses, and `v=` / `argv=` / `caps=` / `opens=` are trailing `key=value` fields (the shape WASM.TXT already uses). The Go seat decodes the tail and launches the row's argv, reporting `gotabwm: apps decode n=14 v=2 schema=2 argv=0 caps=5 opens=4`; `opens=` names M81b's mime types, pinned against that package. All three readers now share `sexiburger.manifest_buf_max` — the 1024 B buffers would have cut the tail rows out of the Zig seats' menus with no error), M82c (#1770 — `virelai/chords` is the global shortcuts registry: 51 rows, one owner per chord PER DISPATCH POINT (`kernel-terminal` frozen chrome / `seat` / `app/<binary>`, because focus is exclusive — GOEDIT.ELF and NOTE.ELF legally share ctrl+s). `Validate()` refuses two owners of one chord with the named `ErrChordConflict` sentence; the seat's `handleWmKey` is now a registry walk (exact mods+usage match), the seat's fail-closed prologue refuses the `/host/GOTABWM.CHORDCONFLICT` fixture and dumps the table, and GOSET's shortcuts view (ctrl+shift+h — re-bound from ctrl+shift+s at the M81g rebase, which landed the seat's snapshot arm on that chord first) shows the table. `go-wm-hid` run 08 asserts the refusal, the dump and the view). | #1782 |

## Gate status

> All class-A (portable) and class-B (VZ hardware) gates are green at HEAD.
> Gate classes are defined in [`docs/gate-inventory.md`](gate-inventory.md).
> Since M40 the class-B fleet is **discovered** from `tools/gate/specs/` via
> `tools/gate/fleet.sh`; the generated inventory is
> [`gate-fleet-inventory.md`](gate-fleet-inventory.md) (snapshot; `--check` is spec-order + locale, not a PR commit).

| Gate | Command | Result |
|------|---------|--------|
| Format | `zig fmt --check boot/src/*.zig kernel/src/*.zig build.zig` | ✅ |
| Guest build | `zig build` | ✅ |
| Disk image | `zig build image` | ✅ |
| Binary + image inspect | `zig build inspect` | ✅ |
| Swift runner build | `swift build --package-path host/vm-runner` | ✅ |
| Context snapshot | `zig build context` | ✅ |
| Unit tests | `zig build test` (parallel; host suites across `kernel/`, `user/`, `test/` — the count is not script-derived, and M71i #1568 removed the 21 `lib/html` tests with their module) | ✅ |
| Class-A portable set | `just verify-portable` | ✅ |
| Class-B VZ fleet | `just verify-vz` (226 members; sharded ×4 in CI + nightly once `VZ_RUNNER_LABEL` names a runner) | ✅ on the reference host; ⛔ 0 gates run in CI |
| Coordination gate | `just verify-coordination` + `just test-coordination` | ✅ |

Per-gate evidence lives in the run logs / CI. Verbose per-gate notes (M3-era
shim ladder, NVRAM console, custom-virtio, the M5 net sweep, …) are in git
history at `e5480c9`.

## Assumptions & gaps (checked against merged `main`)

- **ADR 0004 console:** polled TX-only virtio-pci (DID 0x1043, BAR 0x100010000; RX followed).
- **Runner serial input:** `VZFileHandleSerialPortAttachment(nil)`; `--console` wires stdin (M1.5).
- **Memory:** `memorySize = 256 MiB`; `mem` derives from the captured map.
- **Kernel is post-`ExitBootServices` and never returns** (handoff v2 in x3, ends in a WFE loop).
- **Firmware quirks:** `ConOut` is not routed to virtio; the kernel drives the console itself. See `hardware-contract.md`.

## Multiagent coordination

Claims are **GitHub issues labeled `claim`** — one issue per piece of work,
filed before code is written. Binding rules (mirrored in `AGENTS.md`):

1. **The card IS the claim.** Claim an existing card in place
   (`just claim-card <issue>`); file a new issue only when there is no card.
   An OPEN `claim` issue is an ACTIVE claim — another agent will not duplicate
   it. The landing PR says `Closes #<claim>` so merge closes it.
2. **One editor per file at a time.** Declare every path/glob in the machine-read
   `Touches` bullet. The gate fails when two open claims from different branches
   declare overlapping `Touches` (generated artifacts are exempt).
3. **Progress and completion live on the issue.** Append comments (never rewrite
   earlier ones); close with a final evidence comment when the work lands or is
   abandoned.
4. **Heartbeats.** A comment/edit keeps a claim alive; 14+ days of silence draws
   a gate warning, ~21+ days and anyone may close it.
5. **Evidence is the gate run**, not a committed log (see `AGENTS.md`).
6. **The gate:** `bash tools/status/verify-issue-coordination.sh`
   (`just verify-coordination`, also CI) reads open `claim` issues via `gh` and
   fails on `Touches` overlaps; `bash tools/status/test-coordination.sh`
   (`just test-coordination`) tests the tooling offline.

The old file-based tracker (`docs/claims/` + `docs/logs/`) was deleted
2026-09-03; old four-digit claim numbers in prose are git-history references.

## Housekeeping conventions

- **This file is the single source of truth** for status, and stays a compact
  table. Per-card detail goes on the issue; per-arc detail goes in one
  `docs/march-m*.md` or ADR.
- **Evidence under `artifacts/`** (gitignored). No evidence ⇒ not observed.
- **Facts vs inference:** hypotheses are tagged `(inferred)`; hardware tags flip
  only with saved logs.
- **Branch hygiene:** `agent/...` branches → PR against `main` (ADR 0003).
- **New gates are declarative specs** under `tools/gate/specs/` (never a new
  `verify-*.sh`); extend an existing spec when it already covers the change.
